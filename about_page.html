        <h2>Research Question</h2>
        <p>The story of <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i> has influenced wrtiers of fiction,
            particularly the bob and wheel stanzas, five-line groups at the end of longer sections
            reacting to the events which have just taken place. has been printed and told over and
            over again since it was first written in the late 14th century, little knowledge exists
            regarding its author, a man known only as the <q>Pearl Poet</q>. Although he remains a
            mysterious figure, it seems as though the Poet shifts voice during segments like the bob
            and wheel, and he certainly takes on a breadth of characters. Thus, during our initial
            introduction to XML and other programming languages and subsequent project search, we
            asked: could computing various cultural references and where they occur in the text give
            any insight into the authorial intent of the Pearl Poet himself?</p>
        <h2>About the Text</h2>
        <p>We began our research using a TEI encoded XML version of <i>Gawain</i> downloaded from
            the University of Oxford Text Archive (link: http://www.ota.ox.ac.uk/text/3306), with a
            translation done by J.R.R. Tolkien and E.V. Gordon. This translated version kept to the
            Middle English of the type, and maintained the use of symbols signifying letter
            combinations. Ryan spearheaded the markup process, due to his knowledge and experience
            with Middle English and the story of <i>Gawain</i> in general.</p>
