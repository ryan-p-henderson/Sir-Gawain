            <p>
        Soon as the siege and assault had ceased at Troy,<br/>
the burg broken and burnt to brands and ashes,<br/>
the traitor who trammels of treason there wrought<br/>
was tried for his treachery, the foulest on earth.<br/>
It was Aeneas the noble and his high kin<br/>
who then subdued provinces, lords they became,<br/>
well-nigh of all the wealth in the Western Isles:<br/>
forth rich Romulus to Rome rapidly came,<br/>
with great business that burg he builds up first,<br/>
and names it with his name, as now it has;<br/>
Ticius to Tuscany, and townships begins;<br/>
Langobard in Lombardy lifts up homes;<br/>
and fared over the French flood Felix Brutus<br/>
on many banks all broad Britain he settles<br/>
then,<br/>
where war and wreck and wonder<br/>
betimes have worked within,<br/>
and oft both bliss and blunder<br/>
have held sway swiftly since.<br/></p>
<p>                             

And when this Britain was built by this baron rich,<br/>
bold men were bred therein, of battle beloved,<br/>
in many a troubled time turmoil that wrought.<br/>
More flames on this fold have fallen here oft<br/>
than any other I know of, since that same time.<br/>
But of all that here built, of Britain the kings,<br/>
ever was Arthur highest, as I have heard tell.<br/>
And so of earnest adventure I aim to show,<br/>
that astonishes sight as some men do hold it,<br/>
an outstanding action of Arthur’s wonders.<br/>
If you will list to this lay but a little while,<br/>
I’ll tell it straight, as I in town heard it,<br/>
with tongue;<br/>
          as it was said and spoken<br/>
          in story staunch and strong,<br/>
          with linked letters loaded,<br/>
          as in this land so long.<br/></p>
<p>                             

This king lay at Camelot nigh on Christmas<br/>
with many lovely lords, of leaders the best,<br/>
reckoning of the Round Table all the rich brethren,<br/>
with right ripe revel and reckless mirth.<br/>
There tourneyed tykes by times full many,<br/>
jousted full jollily these gentle knights,<br/>
then carried to court, their carols to make.<br/>
For there the feast was alike full fifteen days,<br/>
with all the meat and mirth men could devise:<br/>
such clamour and glee glorious to hear,<br/>
dear din in the daylight, dancing of nights;<br/>
all was happiness high in halls and chambers<br/>
with lords and ladies, as liked them all best.<br/>
With all that’s well in the world were they together,<br/>
the knights best known under the Christ Himself,<br/>
and the loveliest ladies that ever life honoured,<br/>
and he the comeliest king that the court rules.<br/>
For all were fair folk and in their first age<br/>
still,<br/>
          the happiest under heaven,<br/>
          king noblest in his will;<br/>
          that it were hard to reckon<br/>
          so hardy a host on hill.<br/></p>
<p>                             

While New Year was so young it was new come in,<br/>
that day double on the dais was the dole served,<br/>
for the king was come with knights into the hall,<br/>
and chanting in the chapel had chimed to an end.<br/>
Loud cry was there cast of clerics and others,<br/>
Noel nurtured anew, and named full oft;<br/>
and see the rich run forth to render presents,<br/>
yelled their gifts on high, yield them to hand,<br/>
argued busily about those same gifts.<br/>
Ladies laughed out loud, though they had lost,<br/>
while he that won was not wrath, that you’ll know.<br/>
All this mirth they made at the meal time.<br/>
When they had washed well they went to be seated,<br/>
the best of the barons above, as it seemed best;<br/>
with Guinevere, full gaily, gracing their midst,<br/>
dressed on the dais there, adorned all about –<br/>
splendid silk by her sides, and sheer above<br/>
of true Toulouse, of Tartar tapestries plenty,<br/>
that were embroidered, bright with the best gems<br/>
that might be price-proved with pennies<br/>
any a day.<br/>
          the comeliest to descry<br/>
          glanced there with eyen grey;<br/>
          a seemlier ever to the sight,<br/>
          sooth might no man say.<br/></p>
<p>                             

But Arthur would not eat till all were served,<br/>
he was so joyous a youth, and somewhat boyish:<br/>
he liked his life lively, he loved the less<br/>
either to long lie idle or to long sit,<br/>
so busied him his young blood and his brain wild.<br/>
And also another matter moved him so,<br/>
that he had nobly named he would never eat<br/>
on such dear days, before he had been advised,<br/>
of some adventurous thing, an unknown tale,<br/>
of some mighty marvel, that he might believe,<br/>
of ancestors, arms, or other adventures;<br/>
or else till someone beseeched for some sure knight<br/>
to join with him in jousting, in jeopardy to lay,<br/>
lay down life for life, allow each to the other,<br/>
as fortune might favour them, a fair advantage.<br/>
This was the king’s custom when he in court was,<br/>
at each fine feast among his many friends<br/>
in hall.<br/>
          Therefore with fearless face<br/>
          he stands straight and tall;<br/>
          full lively at that New Year<br/>
          much mirth he makes with all.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Thus there stands straight and tall the king himself,<br/>
talking at the high table of trifles full courtly.<br/>
There good Gawain was graced by Guinevere beside,<br/>
and Agravain a la dure main on the other side sits,<br/>
both the king’s sister-sons and full sure knights;<br/>
Bishop Baldwin above, he begins the table,<br/>
and Ywain, Urien’s son, ate alongside him.<br/>
These sat high on the dais and deftly served,<br/>
and many another sat sure at the side-tables.<br/>
Then the first course came with crack of trumpets,<br/>
with many a banner full bright that thereby hung;<br/>
new noise of kettledrums and noble pipes,<br/>
wild warbles and wide wakened echoes,<br/>
that many a heart full high heaved at their notes.<br/>
Dainties drawn in therewith of full dear meats,<br/>
foods of the freshest, and in such files of dishes<br/>
they find no room to place them people before<br/>
and to set the silver that holds such servings<br/>
on cloth.<br/>
          Each his load as he liked himself,<br/>
          there ladled and nothing loath;<br/>
          Every two had dishes twelve,<br/>
          good beer and bright wine both.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Now will I of their service say you no more,<br/>
for each man may well know no want was there<br/>
another noise full new neared with speed,<br/>
that would give the lord leave to take meat.<br/>
For scarce was the noise not a while ceased,<br/>
and the first course in the court duly served,<br/>
there hales in at the hall door a dreadful man,<br/>
the most in the world’s mould of measure high,<br/>
from the nape to the waist so swart and so thick,<br/>
and his loins and his limbs so long and so great<br/>
half giant on earth I think now that he was;<br/>
but the most of man anyway I mean him to be,<br/>
and that the finest in his greatness that might ride,<br/>
for of back and breast though his body was strong,<br/>
both his belly and waist were worthily small,<br/>
and his features all followed his form made<br/>
and clean.<br/>
          Wonder at his hue men displayed,<br/>
          set in his semblance seen;<br/>
          he fared as a giant were made,<br/>
          and over all deepest green.<br/></p>
<p>                             

And all garbed in green this giant and his gear:<br/>
a straight coat full tight that stuck to his sides,<br/>
a magnificent mantle above, masked within<br/>
with pelts pared pertly, the garment agleam<br/>
with blithe ermine full bright, and his hood both,<br/>
that was left from his locks and laid on his shoulders;<br/>
neat, well-hauled hose of that same green<br/>
that clung to his calves and sharp spurs under<br/>
of bright gold, on silk stockings rich-barred,<br/>
and no shoes under sole where the same rides.<br/>
And all his vesture verily was bright verdure,<br/>
both the bars of his belt and other bright stones,<br/>
that were richly rayed in his bright array<br/>
about himself and his saddle, on silk work,<br/>
it were tortuous to tell of these trifles the half,<br/>
embroidered above with birds and butterflies,<br/>
with gay gaudy of green, the gold ever inmost.<br/>
The pendants of his harness, the proud crupper,<br/>
his bridle and all the metal enamelled was then;<br/>
the stirrups he stood on stained with the same,<br/>
and his saddle bows after, and saddle skirts,<br/>
ever glimmered and glinted all with green stones.<br/>
The horse he rode on was also of that hue,<br/>
certain:<br/>
          A green horse great and thick,<br/>
          a steed full strong to restrain,<br/>
          in broidered bridle quick –<br/>
          to the giant he brought gain.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Well garbed was this giant geared in green,<br/>
and the hair of his head like his horse’s mane.<br/>
Fair fanned-out flax enfolds his shoulders;<br/>
A beard big as a bush over his breast hangs,<br/>
that with the haul of hair that from his head reaches<br/>
was clipped all round about above his elbows,<br/>
that half his hands thereunder were hid in the wise<br/>
of a king’s broad cape that’s clasped at his neck.<br/>
The mane of that mighty horse was much alike,<br/>
well crisped and combed, with knots full many<br/>
plaited in thread of gold about the fair green,<br/>
here a thread of the hair, and there of gold.<br/>
The tail and his forelock twinned, of a suit,<br/>
and bound both with a band of a bright green,<br/>
dressed with precious stones, as its length lasted;<br/>
then twined with a thong, a tight knot aloft,<br/>
where many bells bright of burnished gold ring.<br/>
Such a man on a mount, such a giant that rides,<br/>
was never before that time in hall in sight of human<br/>
eye.<br/>
          He looked as lightning bright,<br/>
          said all that him descried;<br/>
          it seemed that no man might<br/>
          his mighty blows survive.<br/></p>
<p>                             

And yet he had no helm nor hauberk, neither,<br/>
nor protection, nor no plate pertinent to arms,<br/>
nor no shaft, nor no shield, to strike and smite,<br/>
but in his one hand he held a holly branch,<br/>
that is greatest in green when groves are bare,<br/>
and an axe in his other, one huge, monstrous,<br/>
a perilous spar to expound in speech, who might.<br/>
The head of an ell-rod its large length had,<br/>
the spike all of green steel and of gold hewn,<br/>
the blade bright burnished with a broad edge<br/>
as well shaped to sheer as are sharp razors.<br/>
The shaft of a strong staff the stern man gripped,<br/>
that was wound with iron to the wand’s end,<br/>
and all engraved with green in gracious workings;<br/>
a cord lapped it about, that linked at the head,<br/>
and so around the handle looped full oft,<br/>
with tried tassels thereto attached enough<br/>
on buttons of the bright green broidered full rich.<br/>
This stranger rides in and the hall enters,<br/>
driving to the high dais, danger un-fearing.<br/>
Hailed he never a one, but high he overlooked.<br/>
The first word that he spoke: ‘Where is,’ he said,<br/>
‘the governor of this throng? Gladly I would<br/>
see that soul in sight and with himself speak<br/>
reason.’<br/>
          On knights he cast his eyes,<br/>
          And rolled them up and down.<br/>
          He stopped and studied ay<br/>
          who was of most renown.<br/></p>
<p>                             

There was a looking at length the man to behold,<br/>
for each man marvelled what it might mean<br/>
for a rider and his horse to own such a hue<br/>
as grew green as the grass and greener it seemed,<br/>
than green enamel on gold glowing the brighter.<br/>
All studied that steed, and stalked him near,<br/>
with all the wonder of the world at what he might do.<br/>
for marvels had they seen but such never before;<br/>
and so of phantom and fairie the folk there it deemed.<br/>
Therefore to answer was many a knight afraid,<br/>
and all stunned at his shout and sat stock-still<br/>
in a sudden silence through the rich hall;<br/>
as all had slipped into sleep so ceased their noise<br/>
                    and cry.<br/>
          I think it not all in fear,<br/>
          but some from courtesy;<br/>
          to let him all should revere<br/>
          speak to him firstly.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then Arthur before the high dais that adventure beholds,<br/>
and, gracious, him reverenced, a-feared was he never,<br/>
and said: ‘Sir, welcome indeed to this place,<br/>
the head of this house, I, Arthur am named.<br/>
Alight swiftly adown and rest, I thee pray,<br/>
and what thy will is we shall wait after.’<br/>
‘Nay, so help me,’ quoth the man, ‘He that on high sits:<br/>
to wait any while in this way, it was not my errand.<br/>
But as the light of thee, lord, is lifted so high,<br/>
and thy burg and thy barons the best, men hold,<br/>
strongest under steel gear on steeds to ride,<br/>
the wisest and worthiest of the world’s kind,<br/>
proof to play against in other pure sports,<br/>
and here is shown courtesy, as I have heard said,<br/>
so then I wandered hither, indeed, at this time.<br/>
You may be sure by this branch that I bear here<br/>
that I pass by in peace and no plight seek.<br/>
For were I found here, fierce, and in fighting wise,<br/>
I had a hauberk at home and a helm both,<br/>
a shield and a sharp spear, shining bright,<br/>
and other weapons to wield, I well will, too;<br/>
but as I wish no war, I wear the softer.<br/>
But if you be as bold as all bairns tell,<br/>
you will grant me goodly the gift that I ask<br/>
                    by right.’<br/>
          Arthur answered there,<br/>
          and said: ‘Sir courteous knight,<br/>
          if you crave battle bare,<br/>
          here fails you not the fight.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Nay, follow I no fight, in faith I thee tell.<br/>
About on these benches are but beardless children;<br/>
if I were clasped in armour on a high steed,<br/>
here is no man to match me, his might so weak.<br/>
From thee I crave in this court a Christmas gift,<br/>
for it is Yule and New Year, and here many young men.<br/>
If any so hardy in this house holds himself,<br/>
is so bold of blood, hot-brained in his head,<br/>
that dare staunchly strike a stroke for another,<br/>
I shall give him as gift this weapon so rich,<br/>
this blade, that is heavy enough to handle as he likes,<br/>
and I will bear the first blow, as bare as I sit.<br/>
If any friend be so fell as to fare as I say,<br/>
Leap lightly to me; latch on to this weapon –<br/>
I quit claim for ever, he keeps it, his own.<br/>
And I will stand his stroke straight, on this floor,<br/>
if you will grant me the gift to give him another,<br/>
                    again;<br/>
          and yet give him respite<br/>
          a twelvemonth and a day.<br/>
          Now hurry, let’s see aright<br/>
          dare any herein aught say.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

If he had stunned them at first, stiller were then<br/>
all the host in the hall, the high and the low.<br/>
The man on his mount he turned in his saddle,<br/>
and roundly his red eyes he rolled about,<br/>
bent his bristling brows, burning green,<br/>
waving his beard about waiting who would rise.<br/>
When none would come to his call he coughed full high,<br/>
and cleared his throat full richly, ready to speak:<br/>
‘What, is this Arthur’s house,’ quoth the horseman then,<br/>
‘that all the rumour runs of, through realms so many?<br/>
Where now your superiority and your conquests,<br/>
your grinding down and your anger, your great words?<br/>
Now is the revel and the renown of the Round Table<br/>
overthrown with the word of a wanderer’s speech,<br/>
for all duck down in dread without dint of a blow!’<br/>
With this he laughed so loud that the lord grieved;<br/>
the blood shot for shame into his fair face<br/>
                    and there,<br/>
          he waxed as wrath as wind;<br/>
          so did all that there were.<br/>
          The king, so keen by kind,<br/>
          then stood that strong man near.<br/></p>
<p>                             

And said: ‘Horseman, by heaven you ask as a fool,<br/>
and as a folly you fain, to find it me behoves.<br/>
I know no guest that’s aghast at your great words.<br/>
Give me now your weapon, upon God’s name,<br/>
and I shall bear you the boon you’d be having.’<br/>
lightly he leaped to him and caught at his hand;<br/>
then fiercely the other fellow on foot alighted.<br/>
Now has Arthur his axe, and the helm grips,<br/>
and strongly stirs it about, to strike with a thought.<br/>
The man before him drew himself to full height,<br/>
higher than any in the house by a head and more.<br/>
With stern face where he stood he stroked his beard,<br/>
and with fixed countenance tugged at his coat,<br/>
no more moved or dismayed by mighty blows<br/>
than if any man to the bench had brought him a drink<br/>
                    of wine.<br/>
          Gawain, that sat by the queen,<br/>
          to the king he did incline:<br/>
          ‘I beseech in plain speech<br/>
          that this mêlée be mine’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Would you, worthiest lord,’ quoth Gawain to the king,<br/>
‘bid me bow from this bench and stand by you there,<br/>
that I without villainy might void this table,<br/>
and if my liege lady liked it not ill,<br/>
I would come counsel you before your court rich.<br/>
For I think it not seemly, as it is true known,<br/>
that such an asking is heaved so high in your hall,<br/>
that you yourself are tempted, to take it to yourself,<br/>
while so many bold men about you on benches sit,<br/>
that under heaven, I hope, are none higher of will,<br/>
nor better of body on fields where battle is raised.<br/>
I am the weakest, I know, and of wit feeblest.<br/>
least worth the loss of my life, who’d learn the truth.<br/>
Only inasmuch as you are my uncle, am I praised:<br/>
No bounty but your blood in my body I know.<br/>
And since this thing is folly and naught to you falls,<br/>
and I have asked it of you first, grant it to me;<br/>
and if my cry be not comely, let this court be free<br/>
of blame.’<br/>
          Nobles whispered around,<br/>
          and after counselled the same,<br/>
          to free the king and crown,<br/>
          and give Gawain the game.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then commanded the king the knight for to rise,<br/>
and he readily up-rose and prepared him fair,<br/>
knelt down before the king, and caught the weapon;<br/>
and he lightly left it him, and lifted up his hand<br/>
and gave him God’s blessing, and gladly him bade<br/>
that his heart and his hand should hardy be, both.<br/>
‘Take care, cousin,’ quoth the king, ‘how you set on,<br/>
and if you read him aright, readily I trow,<br/>
that you shall abide the blow he shall bring after.’<br/>
Gawain goes to the giant, with weapon in hand,<br/>
and boldly abides him, never bothered the less.<br/>
Then to Sir Gawain says the knight in the green:<br/>
‘Re-affirm we our oaths before we go further.<br/>
First I entreat you, man, how are you named,<br/>
that tell me truly, then, so trust it I may.’<br/>
‘In God’s faith,’ quoth the good knight, ‘Gawain am I,<br/>
that bear you this buffet, whatever befalls after,<br/>
and at this time twelvemonth take from thee another<br/>
with what weapon you wilt, and no help from any<br/>
                    alive.’<br/>
          The other replies again:<br/>
          ‘Sir Gawain, may I so thrive,<br/>
          if I am not wondrous fain<br/>
          for you this blow to drive.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘By God,’ quoth the green knight, ‘Sir Gawain, I like<br/>
That I’ll face first from your fist what I found here.<br/>
And you have readily rehearsed, with reason full true,<br/>
clearly all the covenant that I the king asked,<br/>
save that you shall secure me, say, by your troth,<br/>
that you shall seek me yourself, where so you think<br/>
I may be found upon field, and fetch you such wages<br/>
as you deal me today before this dear company.’<br/>
‘Where should I seek,’ quoth Gawain, ‘where is your place?<br/>
I know nothing of where you walk, by Him that wrought me,<br/>
nor do I know you, knight, your court or your name.<br/>
But teach me truly the track, tell me how you are named,<br/>
and I shall wind all my wit to win me thither;<br/>
and that I swear you in truth, and by my sure honour.’<br/>
‘That is enough this New Year, it needs no more,’<br/>
quoth the giant in the green to courteous Gawain:<br/>
‘if I shall tell you truly, when you have tapped me<br/>
and you me smoothly have smitten, I swiftly you teach,<br/>
of my house and my home and my own name.<br/>
Then may you find how I fare, and hold to your word;<br/>
and if I spend no speech, then it speeds you the better,<br/>
for you may linger in your land and seek no further –<br/>
                    but oh!<br/>
          Take now your grim steel to thee,<br/>
          and see how you fell oaks.’<br/>
          ‘Gladly, sir, indeed,’<br/>
          quoth Gawain; his axe he strokes.<br/></p>
<p>                             

The green knight on his ground graciously stands:<br/>
with a little lean of the head, flesh he uncovers;<br/>
his long lovely locks he laid over his crown,<br/>
and let the naked neck to the stroke show.<br/>
Gawain gripped his axe and glanced it on high,<br/>
his left foot on the field before him he set,<br/>
letting it down lightly light on the naked,<br/>
that the sharp of the steel sundered the bones,<br/>
and sank through the soft flesh, sliced it in two,<br/>
that the blade of the bright steel bit in the ground.<br/>
The fair head from the frame fell to the earth,<br/>
that folk flailed it with their feet, where it forth rolled;<br/>
the blood burst from the body, the bright on the green.<br/>
Yet nevertheless neither falters nor falls the fellow,<br/>
but stoutly he started forth on strong shanks,<br/>
and roughly he reached out, where the ranks stood,<br/>
latched onto his lovely head, and lifted it so;<br/>
and then strode to his steed, the bridle he catches,<br/>
steps into stirrup and strides him aloft,<br/>
and his head by the hair in his hand holds.<br/>
and as steady and staunch him in his saddle sat<br/>
as if no mishap had him ailed, though headless now<br/>
                    instead.<br/>
          He twined his trunk about,<br/>
          that ugly body that bled;<br/>
          many of him had doubt,<br/>
          ere ever his speech was said.<br/></p>
<p>                             

For the head in his hand he holds up even,<br/>
towards the dearest on dais addresses the face;<br/>
and it lifted its eyelids, and looked full wide,<br/>
and made this much with its mouth, as you may now hear;<br/>
‘Look, Gawain, be you geared to go as you promised,<br/>
and look out loyally till you me, lord, find,<br/>
as you swore oath in this hall, these knights hearing.<br/>
To the green chapel you go, I charge you, to find<br/>
such a dint as you dealt – deserved you have –<br/>
to be readily yielded on New Year’s morn.<br/>
The knight of the green chapel, men know me as, many;<br/>
therefore to find me, if you fain it, you’ll fail never.<br/>
Come then, or be called recreant it behoves you.’<br/>
With a rough rasping the reins he twists,<br/>
hurled out the hall door, his head in his hand,<br/>
that the fire of the flint flew from fleet hooves.<br/>
to what land he came no man there knew,<br/>
no more than they knew where he had come from<br/>
                    what then?<br/>
          The king and Gawain there<br/>
          at that green man laugh and grin;<br/>
          yet broadcast it was abroad<br/>
          as a marvel among those men.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Though Arthur the high king at heart had wonder,<br/>
he let no semblance be seen, but said aloud<br/>
to the comely queen, with courteous speech:<br/>
‘Dear dame, today dismay you never;<br/>
well become us these crafts at Christmas,<br/>
larking at interludes, to laugh and to sing<br/>
among the courtly carols of lords and ladies.<br/>
Nevertheless my meat I may now me address,<br/>
for I have seen my marvel, I may not deny.’<br/>
He glanced at Sir Gawain and graciously said:<br/>
‘Now sir, hang up your axe that has hewn enough.’<br/>
And it adorned the dais, hung on display,<br/>
where all men might marvel and on it look,<br/>
and by true title thereof to tell the wonder.<br/>
Then they went to the board these two together,<br/>
the king and the godly knight, and keen men them served<br/>
of all dainties double, as dearest might fall,<br/>
with all manner of meat and minstrelsy both.<br/>
Full well they whiled that day till it worked its end<br/>
                    on land<br/>
          Now think well, Sir Gawain,<br/>
          lest by peril unmanned,<br/>
          this adventure to sustain,<br/>
          you have taken in hand.<br/></p>
                        <h3 id="II">II</h3><br/>

  <p>                            

This gift of adventure has Arthur thus on the first<br/>
of the young year, for he yearned exploits to hear.<br/>
Though words were wanting when they went to sit,<br/>
now are they stoked with stern work, fullness to hand.<br/>
Gawain was glad to begin those games in hall,<br/>
yet if the end be heavy, have you no wonder;<br/>
though men be merry in mind when they have strong ale,<br/>
a year turns full turn, and yields never a like;<br/>
the form of its finish foretold full seldom.<br/>
For this Yuletide passed by, and the year after,<br/>
and each season slips by pursuing another:<br/>
after Christmas comes crabbed Lenten time,<br/>
that forces on flesh fish and food more simple.<br/>
But then the weather of the world with winter it fights,<br/>
cold shrinks down, clouds are uplifted,<br/>
shining sheds the rain in showers full warm,<br/>
falls upon fair flats, flowers there showing.<br/>
Both ground and groves green is their dress,<br/>
birds begin to build and brightly sing they<br/>
the solace of the soft summer ensuing after<br/>
                    on bank;<br/>
          and blossoms bloom to blow<br/>
          by hedges rich and rank,<br/>
          while noble notes do flow<br/>
          in woodland free and frank.<br/></p>
<p>                             

After, in season of summer with the soft winds,<br/>
when Zephyrus sighs himself on seeds and herbs;<br/>
well-away is the wort that waxes out there,<br/>
when the dunking dew drops from the leaves,<br/>
biding a blissful blush of the bright sun.<br/>
But then hies Harvest and hardens it soon,<br/>
warns it before the winter to wax full ripe;<br/>
then drives with drought the dust for to rise,<br/>
from the face of the field to fly full high;<br/>
wild wind from the welkin wrestles the sun,<br/>
the leaves lance then from linden, light on the ground,<br/>
and all grey is the grass, that green was ere;<br/>
then all ripens and rots, that rose up at first.<br/>
And thus wears the year into yesterdays many,<br/>
and winter walks again, as the world’s way is,<br/>
                    I gauge,<br/>
          till Michaelmas moon<br/>
          threatens a wintry age.<br/>
          Then thinks Gawain full soon,<br/>
          of his wearisome voyage.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Yet till All-Hallows with Arthur he lingers,<br/>
and he made a feast on that day for the knight’s sake,<br/>
with much revel and rich of the Round Table.<br/>
Knights full courteous and comely ladies,<br/>
all for love of that lad in longing they were;<br/>
but nevertheless they named nothing but mirth,<br/>
many joyless for that gentle soul jokes made there.<br/>
For, after meat, with mourning he makes to his uncle,<br/>
and speaks his departure, and openly says:<br/>
‘Now, liege lord of my life, I ask you leave.<br/>
You know the cost in this case, care I no more<br/>
to tell you the trial thereof, naught but a trifle;<br/>
but I am bound to bear it, be gone, and tomorrow,<br/>
to seek the giant in the green, as God will me guide.’<br/>
Then the best of the burg were brought together,<br/>
Ywain and Eric and others full many,<br/>
Sir Dodinal le Sauvage, the Duke of Clarence,<br/>
Lancelot and Lionel and Lucan the Good,<br/>
Sir Bors and Sir Bedivere, big men both,<br/>
and many other men, with Mador de la Porte.<br/>
All this courtly company came the king near,<br/>
for to counsel the knight, with care in their hearts.<br/>
There was much dark dolefulness deep in the hall,<br/>
that so worthy as Gawain should wend on that errand,<br/>
to endure a dreadful dint, and no more with sword<br/>
                    wander.<br/>
          The knight made yet good cheer,<br/>
          and said: ‘Why should I falter?<br/>
          Such destinies foul or fair<br/>
          what can men do but suffer?’<br/></p>
<p>                             

He dwelt there all that day, and dressed on the morn,<br/>
asks early for his arms, and all were they brought.<br/>
First a crimson carpet, cast over the floor,<br/>
and much was the gilded gear that gleamed thereon.<br/>
The strong man steps there, and handles the steel,<br/>
dressed in a doublet of silk of Turkestan,<br/>
and then a well-crafted cape, clasped at the top,<br/>
that with a white ermine was trimmed within.<br/>
Then set they the plate shoes on his strong feet,<br/>
his legs lapped in steel with lovely greaves,<br/>
with knee-pieces pinned thereto, polished full clean,<br/>
about his knees fastened with knots of gold;<br/>
then the cuisses, that cunningly enclosed<br/>
his thick-thewed thighs, attached with thongs;<br/>
and then the hauberk linked with bright steel rings<br/>
over rich wear, wrapped round the warrior;<br/>
and well-burnished bracelets over both arms,<br/>
elbow-pieces good and gay, and gloves of plate,<br/>
and all the goodly gear that should bring him gain<br/>
                    that tide;<br/>
          with rich coat armour,<br/>
          his gold spurs set with pride,<br/>
          girt with a blade full sure<br/>
          with silk sword-belt at his side.<br/></p>
<p>                             

When he was hasped in armour, his harness was rich;<br/>
the least laces or loops gleamed with gold.<br/>
So harnessed as he was he hears the Mass,<br/>
offered and honoured at the high altar,<br/>
then he comes to the king and his companions,<br/>
takes his courteous leave of lords and ladies;<br/>
and they him kiss and convey, commend him to Christ.<br/>
By then Gringolet was game, girt with a saddle<br/>
that gleamed full gaily with many gold fringes,<br/>
everywhere nailed full new, for that noted day;<br/>
the bridle barred about, with bright gold bound;<br/>
the apparel of the breast-guard and proud skirts,<br/>
crupper, caparison, in accord with the saddle-bows;<br/>
and all was arrayed with rich red gold nails,<br/>
that all glittered and glinted as gleam of the sun.<br/>
Then hefts he the helm, and hastily it kisses,<br/>
that was strongly stapled and stuffed within.<br/>
It was high on his head, clasped behind,<br/>
with a light covering over the face-guard,<br/>
embroidered and bound with the best gems<br/>
on broad silken border, and birds on the seams,<br/>
such as parrots painted preening between,<br/>
turtle-doves, true-love knots, so thick entailed<br/>
as many burdened with it had been seven winters<br/>
                    in town.<br/>
          The circlet of greater price<br/>
          that embellished his crown,<br/>
          of diamonds all devised<br/>
          that were both bright and brown.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then they showed him the shield that was of shining gules,<br/>
with the pentangle painted there in pure gold hues.<br/>
He brandishes it by the baldric, casts it about his neck,<br/>
that suited the wearer seemly and fair.<br/>
And why the pentangle applies to that prince noble,<br/>
I intend to tell, though I tarry more than I should.<br/>
It is a sign Solomon settled on some while back,<br/>
in token of truth, by the title that it has,<br/>
for it is a figure that has five points,<br/>
and each line overlaps and locks with another,<br/>
and everywhere it is endless, and English call it<br/>
over all the land, as I here, the Endless Knot.<br/>
For so it accords with this knight and his bright arms,<br/>
forever faithful in five ways, and five times so,<br/>
Gawain was for good known, and, as purified gold,<br/>
void of every villainy, with virtues adorned<br/>
                    all, so.<br/>
          And thus the pentangle new<br/>
          he bore on shield and coat,<br/>
          as title of trust most true<br/>
          and gentlest knight of note.<br/></p>
<p>                             

First he was found faultless in his five senses,<br/>
and then failed never the knight in his five fingers,<br/>
and all his trust in the field was in the five wounds<br/>
that Christ caught on the cross, as the creed tells.<br/>
And wheresoever this man in mêlée was stood,<br/>
his first thought was that, over all other things,<br/>
all his force in fight he found in the five joys<br/>
that holy Heaven’s Queen had of her child;<br/>
for this cause the knight fittingly had<br/>
on the inner half of his shield her image painted,<br/>
that when he beheld her his boldness never failed.<br/>
The fifth five that I find the knight used<br/>
was Free-handedness and Friendship above all things;<br/>
his Continence and Courtesy corrupted were never,<br/>
and Piety, that surpasses all points – these pure five<br/>
were firmer founded in his form than another.<br/>
Now all these five-folds, forsooth, were fused in this knight,<br/>
and each one joined to another that none end had,<br/>
and fixed upon five points that failed never,<br/>
never confused on one side, nor sundered neither,<br/>
without end at any angle anywhere, I find,<br/>
wherever its guise begins or glides to an end.<br/>
Therefore on his shining shield shaped was the knot<br/>
royally with red gold upon red gules,<br/>
thus is the pure pentangle called by the people<br/>
of lore.<br/>
          Now geared was Gawain gay,<br/>
          lifted his lance right there,<br/>
          and gave them all good day –<br/>
          as he thought, for evermore.<br/></p>
<p>                             

He struck the steed with the spurs, and sprang on his way<br/>
so strongly the stone-fire sparked out thereafter.<br/>
All that saw the seemly sight sighed in their hearts,<br/>
and said softly the same thing all to each other,<br/>
in care of that comely knight: ‘By Christ, ‘tis pity,<br/>
that you, lord, shall be lost, who art of life noble!<br/>
To find his fellow in field, in faith, is not easy.<br/>
Warily to have wrought would wiser have been,<br/>
to have dealt yon dear man a dukedom of worth.<br/>
A loyal leader of this land’s lances in him well seems,<br/>
and so had better have been than brought to naught,<br/>
beheaded by an elvish man, out of arrogant pride.<br/>
Who knew any king ever such counsel to take<br/>
as knights in altercations in Christmas games?’<br/>
Well was the water warm much wept from eyen,<br/>
when that seemly sire spurred from the court<br/>
                    that day.<br/>
          He made no delay,<br/>
          but swiftly went his way;<br/>
          Many a wild path he strayed,<br/>
          so the books do say.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Now rides this knight through the realm of Logres,<br/>
Sir Gawain, in God’s name, yet no game it thought.<br/>
Oft friendless alone he lay long a-nights,<br/>
where he found no fare that he liked before him.<br/>
He had no friend but his steed by furze and down,<br/>
and no one but God to speak with on the way,<br/>
till that he neared full nigh to northern Wales.<br/>
All the Isle of Anglesey on the left hand he held,<br/>
and fared over the fords by the forelands,<br/>
over at Holyhead, till he reached the bank<br/>
in the wilderness of Wirral – few thereabouts<br/>
that either God or other with good heart loved.<br/>
And ever he asked as he fared, of fellows he met,<br/>
if they had heard any word of a knight in green,<br/>
on any ground thereabout, of the green chapel;<br/>
and all met him with nay, that never in their lives<br/>
saw they ever a sign of such a one, hued<br/>
in green.<br/>
          The knight took pathways strange<br/>
          by many a bank un-green;<br/>
          his cheerfulness would change,<br/>
          ere might that chapel be seen.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Many cliffs he over-clambered in countries strange,<br/>
far flying from his friends forsaken he rides.<br/>
at every twist of the water where the way passed<br/>
he found a foe before him, or freakish it were,<br/>
and so foul and fell he was beholden to fight.<br/>
So many marvels by mountain there the man finds,<br/>
it would be tortuous to tell a tenth of the tale.<br/>
Sometimes with dragons he wars, and wolves also,<br/>
sometimes with wild woodsmen haunting the crags,<br/>
with bulls and bears both, and boar other times,<br/>
and giants that chased after him on the high fells.<br/>
had he not been doughty, enduring, and Duty served,<br/>
doubtless he had been dropped and left for dead,<br/>
for war worried him not so much but winter was worse,<br/>
when the cold clear water from the clouds shed,<br/>
and froze ere it fall might to the fallow earth.<br/>
Near slain by the sleet he slept in his steel<br/>
more nights than enough in the naked rocks,<br/>
where clattering from the crest the cold burn runs,<br/>
and hung high over his head in hard icicles.<br/>
Thus in peril and pain, and plights full hard<br/>
covers the country this knight till Christmas Eve<br/>
                    alone.<br/>
          The knight that eventide<br/>
          to Mary made his moan,<br/>
          to show him where to ride,<br/>
          and guide him to some home.<br/></p>
<p>                             

By a mount in the morn merrily he rides<br/>
into a forest full deep, wonderfully wide,<br/>
high hills on either hand, and woodlands under<br/>
of hoar oaks full huge a hundred together.<br/>
The hazel and the hawthorn were tangled and twined,<br/>
with rough ragged moss ravelled everywhere,<br/>
with many birds un-blithe upon bare twigs,<br/>
that piteously they piped for pinch of the cold.<br/>
The gallant on Gringolet glides them under<br/>
through many a marsh and mire, a man alone,<br/>
full of care lest to his cost he never should<br/>
see the service of that Sire, that on that self night,<br/>
of a bright maid was born, our burden to quell.<br/>
And therefore sighing he said; ‘I beseech thee, Lord,<br/>
and Mary, that is mildest mother so dear,<br/>
of some harbour where highly I might hear Mass,<br/>
and thy Matins tomorrow, meekly I ask,<br/>
and thereto promptly I pray my Pater and Ave<br/>
                    and Creed.’<br/>
          He rode as he prayed,<br/>
          And cried for his misdeeds;<br/>
          He crossed himself always,<br/>
          And said: ‘Christ’s Cross me speed!’<br/></p>
<p>                             

Now he had signed himself times but three,<br/>
when he was aware in the wood of a wall in a moat,<br/>
above a level, on high land locked under boughs<br/>
of many broad set boles about by the ditches:<br/>
a castle the comeliest that ever knight owned,<br/>
perched on a plain, a park all about,<br/>
with a pointed palisade, planted full thick,<br/>
encircling many trees in more than two miles.<br/>
The hold on the one side the knight assessed,<br/>
as it shimmered and shone through the shining oaks.<br/>
Then humbly has off with his helm, highly he thanks<br/>
Jesus and Saint Julian, that gentle are both,<br/>
that courtesy had him shown, and his cry hearkened.<br/>
‘Now hospitality,’ he said, ‘I beseech you grant!’<br/>
Then goads he on Gringolet, with his gilded heels,<br/>
and he by chance there has chosen the chief way,<br/>
that brought the man bravely to the bridge’s end<br/>
                    in haste.<br/>
          The drawbridge was upraised,<br/>
          the gates were firm and fast,<br/>
          the walls were well arrayed –<br/>
          it trembled at no wind’s blast.<br/></p>
<p>                             

The knight stuck to his steed, that hugged the bank,<br/>
of the deep double ditch driven round the place.<br/>
The wall washed in the water wonderfully deep,<br/>
and then a full huge height it haled up aloft,<br/>
of hard hewn stone to the entablature,<br/>
embedded under the battlements in best style;<br/>
and there were turrets full tall towering between,<br/>
with many lovely loopholes clean interlocked:<br/>
a better barbican that knight never beheld.<br/>
And innermost he beheld a hall full high,<br/>
towers trim between, crenellated full thick,<br/>
fair finials that fused, and fancifully long,<br/>
with carven copes, cunningly worked.<br/>
Chalk white chimneys he descried enough,<br/>
on tower rooftops that gleamed full white.<br/>
So many painted pinnacles powdered there<br/>
among castle crenellations, clustered so thick,<br/>
that pared out of paper purely it seemed.<br/>
the fair knight on the horse it fine enough thought,<br/>
if he might contrive to come the cloister within,<br/>
to harbour in that hostel while Holy Day lasted,<br/>
                    all content.
          He called and soon there came<br/>
          a porter pure pleasant.<br/>
          From the wall his errand he craved,<br/>
          and hailed the knight errant.<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Good sir,’ quoth Gawain, ‘will you do my errand<br/>
to the high lord of this house, harbour to crave?’<br/>
‘Yes, by Saint Peter,’ quoth the porter, ‘for I believe<br/>
That you’ll be welcome to dwell as long as you like.’<br/>
Then the welcomer on the wall went down swiftly,<br/>
and folk freely him with, to welcome the knight.<br/>
They let down the great drawbridge and dignified<br/>
knelt down on their knees upon the cold earth<br/>
to welcome this knight as they thought the worthiest way.<br/>
They yielded him the broad gate, opened wide,<br/>
and he them raised rightly and rode over the bridge.<br/>
Several then seized his saddle, while he alighted,<br/>
and then strong men enough stabled his steed.<br/>
Knights and their squires came down then<br/>
for to bring this bold man blithely to hall,<br/>
When he lifted his helmet, they hastened forward<br/>
to heft it from his hand, the guest to serve;<br/>
his blade and his blazon both they took.<br/>
then hailed he full handily the host each one,<br/>
and many proud men pressed close, that prince to honour.<br/>
All clasped in his noble armour to hall they him brought,<br/>
where a fair fire on a hearth fiercely flamed.<br/>
Then the lord of that land left his chamber<br/>
for to meet with manners the man on the floor.<br/>
He said: ‘You are welcome to dwell as you like.<br/>
What is here, is all your own, to have at your will<br/>
                    and wield you.<br/>
          ‘Graunt merci,’ quoth Gawain,<br/>
          ‘May Christ reward it you.’<br/>
          As friends that meet again<br/>
          Each clasped the other true.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Gawain gazed on the gallant that goodly him greet,<br/>
and thought him a brave baron that the burg owned,<br/>
a huge man in truth, and mature in his years;<br/>
broad, bright was his beard and all beaver-hued,<br/>
stern, striding strongly on stalwart shanks,<br/>
face fell as the fire, and free of his speech;<br/>
and well he seemed to suit, as the knight thought,<br/>
the leading a lordship, along of lords full good.<br/>
The chief him led to a chamber, expressly commands<br/>
a lord be delivered to him, him humbly to serve;<br/>
and there were brave for his bidding a band of men,<br/>
that brought him to a bright bower, the bedding was noble,<br/>
of curtains of clear silk with clean gold hems,<br/>
and coverlets full curious with comely panels,<br/>
of bright ermine above embroidered sides,<br/>
curtains running on cords, red gold rings,<br/>
tapestries tied to the wall, of Toulouse, Turkestan,<br/>
and underfoot, on the floor, that followed suit.<br/>
There he was disrobed, with speeches of mirth,<br/>
the burden of his mail and his bright clothes.<br/>
Rich robes full readily retainers brought him,<br/>
to check and to change and choose of the best.<br/>
Soon as he held one, and hastened therein,<br/>
that sat on him seemly, with spreading skirts,<br/>
verdant in his visage Spring verily seemed<br/>
to well nigh everyone, in all its hues,<br/>
glowing and lovely, all his limbs under,<br/>
that a comelier knight never Christ made,<br/>
                    they thought.<br/>
          However he came here,<br/>
          it seemed that he ought<br/>
          to be prince without peer<br/>
          on fields where fell men fought.<br/></p>
<p>                             
        
A chair before the chimney, where charcoal burned,<br/>
graciously set for Gawain, was gracefully adorned,<br/>
coverings on quilted cushions, cunningly crafted both.<br/>
And then a mighty mantle was on that man cast<br/>
of a brown silk, embroidered full rich,<br/>
and fair furred within with pelts of the best –<br/>
the finest ermine on earth – his hood of the same.<br/>
And he sat on that settle seemly and rich,<br/>
and chafed himself closely, and then his cheer mended.<br/>
Straightway a table on trestles was set up full fair,<br/>
clad with a clean cloth that clear white showed,<br/>
the salt-cellars, napkins and silvered spoons.<br/>
The knight washed at his will, and went to his meat.<br/>
Servants him served seemly enough<br/>
with several soups, seasoned of the best,<br/>
double bowlfuls, as fitting, and all kinds of fish,<br/>
some baked in bread, some browned on the coals,<br/>
some seethed, some in stews savoured with spices,<br/>
and sauces ever so subtle that the knight liked.<br/>
While he called it a feast full freely and oft<br/>
most politely, at which all spurred him on politely<br/>
                    again:<br/>
          ‘This penance now you take,<br/>
          after it shall amend.’<br/>
          That man much mirth did make,<br/>
          for the wine to his head did tend.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then they sparred and parried in precious style<br/>
with private points put to the prince himself,<br/>
so he conceded courteously of that court he came,<br/>
where noble Arthur is headman himself alone,<br/>
that is the right royal king of the Round Table;<br/>
and that it is Gawain himself that in that house sits,<br/>
come there at Christmas, as chance has him driven.<br/>
When the lord learned what prince that he there had,<br/>
loud laughed he thereat, so delightful he thought it,<br/>
and all the men in that manse made it a joy<br/>
to appear in his presence promptly that time,<br/>
who all prize and prowess and purest ways<br/>
appends to his person, and praised is ever;<br/>
above all men upon earth his honour is most.<br/>
Each man full softly said to his neighbour:<br/>
‘Now shall we see show of seemliest manners<br/>
and the faultless phrases of noble speaking.<br/>
What superior speech is, unasked we shall learn,<br/>
since we have found this fine master of breeding.<br/>
God has given us of his goodly grace forsooth,<br/>
that such a guest as Gawain grants us to have,<br/>
when barons blithe at His birth shall sit<br/>
                    and sing.<br/>
          The meaning of manners here<br/>
          this knight now shall us bring.<br/>
          I hope whoever may hear<br/>
          Shall learn of love-making.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

When the dinner was done and the diners risen,<br/>
it was nigh on the night that the time was near.<br/>
Chaplains to the chapel took their course,<br/>
ringing all men, richly, as they rightly should,<br/>
to the holy evensong of that high eventide.<br/>
The lord goes thereto and the lady as well;<br/>
into a comely enclosure quietly she enters.<br/>
Gawain gaily goes forth and thither goes soon;<br/>
the lord grasps him by the gown and leads him to sit,<br/>
acknowledges him with grace, calls him by name,<br/>
and said he was the most welcome man in the world;<br/>
and he thanked him thoroughly, they clasped each other,<br/>
and sat with sober seeming the service through.<br/>
Then liked the lady to look on the knight;<br/>
and came from the close with many fine women.<br/>
She was the fairest in feature, in flesh and complexion,<br/>
and in compass and colour and ways, of all others,<br/>
and fairer than Guinevere, as the knight thought.<br/>
He strode through the chancel to squire the dame.<br/>
Another lady her led by the left hand,<br/>
who was older than her, and aged it seemed,<br/>
and highly honoured with her men about her.<br/>
Not alike though to look on those ladies were,<br/>
for if the one was fresh, the other was withered:<br/>
rich red in this one distinguished her,<br/>
rough wrinkled cheeks on that other, in rolls.<br/>
Kerchiefs on this one, with many clear pearls,<br/>
her breast and her bright throat bare displayed<br/>
shone sweeter than snow that’s shed on the hills;<br/>
that other swathed with a wimple wound at the throat,<br/>
clothed to her swarthy chin with chalk-white veils,<br/>
her forehead folded in silk, enveloped everywhere,<br/>
ringed and trellised with trefoils about,<br/>
that naught was bare of the lady but the black brows,<br/>
the two eyen and nose, the naked lips,<br/>
and those were sorry to see, and somewhat bleary –<br/>
a great lady on earth a man might her call,<br/>
                    by God!<br/>
          Her body was short and thick,<br/>
          her buttocks big and broad;<br/>
          Much sweeter a sweet to lick<br/>
          the one at her side for sure.<br/></p>
<p>                             

When Gawain gazed on that gracious-looking girl,<br/>
with leave asked of the lord he went to meet them.<br/>
The elder he hails, bowing to her full low;<br/>
the lovely-looking he laps a little in his arms,<br/>
he kisses her courteously and nobly he speaks.<br/>
They crave his acquaintance, and he quickly asks<br/>
to be their sworn servant, if they themselves wished.<br/>
They take him between them, and talking they lead him<br/>
to a chamber, to the chimney, and firstly they ask for<br/>
spices, which men unstintingly hastened to bring,<br/>
and the winning wine with them, every time.<br/>
The lord laughing aloft leaps full oft,<br/>
minding that mirth be made and many a time,<br/>
nobly lifted his hood, and on a spear hung it,<br/>
and wished him to win the worth and honour thereof<br/>
who most mirth might move at that Christmastide.<br/>
‘And I shall swear, by my faith, to strive with the best<br/>
before I lose the hood, with the help of my friends.’<br/>
Thus with laughing words the lord makes all merry,<br/>
for to gladden Sir Gawain with games in the hall<br/>
                    that night.<br/>
          Till, when it was time,<br/>
          the lord demanded light.<br/>
          Gawain his way did find<br/>
          To bed as best he might.<br/></p>
<p>                             

On the morn, when each man minds that time<br/>
the dear Lord for our destiny to die was born,<br/>
joy waxes in each house in the world for His sake.<br/>
So did it there on that day with dainties many:<br/>
both when major and minor meals were eaten<br/>
deft men on the dais served of the best.<br/>
The old ancient wife highest she sits;<br/>
the lord, so I believe, politely beside her.<br/>
Gawain and the sweet lady together they sat<br/>
in the midst, as the masses came together;<br/>
and then throughout the hall, as seemed right,<br/>
each man in his degree was graciously served.<br/>
There was meat, there was mirth, there was much joy,<br/>
that it would be a trouble for me to tell all,<br/>
and however perchance I pined to make my point.<br/>
But yet I know Gawain and the sweet lady<br/>
such comfort of their company caught together<br/>
through their dear dalliance of courtly words,<br/>
with clean courteous chat, closed from filth,<br/>
their play surpassed every princely game with which it<br/>
                    compares.<br/>
          Kettledrums and trumpets,<br/>
          much piping there of airs;<br/>
          Each man minded his,<br/>
          and those two minded theirs.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Much mirth was there driven that day and another,<br/>
and a third as thickly thronged came in thereafter;<br/>
The joy of St John’s Day was gentle to hear,<br/>
and was the last of the larking, the lords thought.<br/>
There were guests set to go on the grey morn,<br/>
so they stayed wonderfully waking and wine drank,<br/>
dancing the day in with noble carols.<br/>
At the last, when it was time, they took their leave,<br/>
each one to wend on his way into strange parts.<br/>
Gawain gave them good day, the good man grasps him,<br/>
and leads him to his own chamber, the chimney beside,<br/>
and there he grips him tight, heartily thanks him<br/>
for the fine favour that he had shown him,<br/>
so to honour his house on that Christmastide,<br/>
and embellish his burg with his bright cheer.<br/>
‘Indeed, sir, while I live, I am the better<br/>
for Gawain being my guest at God’s own feast.’<br/>
‘Graunt merci, sir,’ quoth Gawain, ‘in good faith it’s yours,<br/>
all the honour is your own – the High King requite you!<br/>
And I am here, at your will, to work your behest,<br/>
as I am beholden to do, in high things and low,<br/>
                    by right.’<br/>
          The lord was at great pains<br/>
          To keep longer the knight;<br/>
          To him answers Gawain<br/>
          That by no means he might.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then the lord aimed full fair at him, asking<br/>
what daring deed had him driven at that dear time<br/>
so keenly from the king’s court to stray all alone,<br/>
before the holy holiday was haled out of town.<br/>
‘Forsooth, sir,’ quoth the knight, ‘you say but the truth,<br/>
a high errand and a hasty had me from those halls,<br/>
for I am summoned myself to seek for a place,<br/>
with no thought in the world where to go find it.<br/>
I would not dare fail find it by New Year’s morning<br/>
for all the land in Logres, so me our Lord help!<br/>
So, sir, this request I make of you here,<br/>
that you tell me true if ever you tale heard<br/>
of the green chapel, on what ground it stands,<br/>
and of the knight that keeps it, the colour of green.<br/>
There was established by statute a pact us between<br/>
both to meet at that mark, if I should live;<br/>
and of that same New Year but little is wanting,<br/>
and I would look on that lord, if God would let me,<br/>
more gladly, by God’s Son, than any goods gain.<br/>
So, indeed, by your leave, it behoves me to go.<br/>
Now to work this business I’ve barely three days,<br/>
and it’s fitter I fall dead than fail of my errand.’<br/>
Then, laughing, quoth the lord: ‘Now stay, it behoves you,<br/>
for I’ll teach you the trysting place ere the term’s end.<br/>
The green chapel upon ground grieve for no more;<br/>
but you shall be in your bed, sir, at your ease,<br/>
while day unfolds, and go forth on the first of the year,<br/>
and come to that mark at mid-morn, to act as you wish<br/>
                    and when.<br/>
          Dwell until New Year’s Day,<br/>
          and rise and ride on then.<br/>
          You shall be shown the way;<br/>
          it is not two miles hence.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then was Gawain full glad, and gleefully he laughed:<br/>
‘Now I thank you thoroughly beyond all things;<br/>
now achieved is my goal, I shall at your will<br/>
dwell here, and do what else you deem fit.’<br/>
Then the lord seized him and set him beside,<br/>
and the ladies had fetched, to please him the better.<br/>
There was seemly solace by themselves still.<br/>
The lord lofted for love notes so merry,<br/>
as one that wanted his wits, nor knew what he did.<br/>
Then he cried to the knight, calling aloud:<br/>
‘You have deemed to do the deed that I bid.<br/>
Will you hold to this promise here and now?’<br/>
‘Yes, sire, indeed,’ said the knight and true,<br/>
‘While I bide in your burg, I’m at your behest.’<br/>
‘As you have travelled,’ quoth the lord, ‘from afar,<br/>
and since then waked with me, you are not well served<br/>
neither of sustenance nor of sleep, surely I know.<br/>
You shall linger in your room and lie there at ease<br/>
tomorrow till Mass, and then to meat wend<br/>
when you will, with my wife, that with you shall sit<br/>
and comfort you with company, till I come to court:<br/>
                    time spend,<br/>
          And I shall early rise;<br/>
          a-hunting will I wend.’<br/>
          Gawain thinks it wise,<br/>
          as is fitting to him bends.<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘And further,’ quoth the lord, ‘a bargain we’ll make:<br/>
whatsoever I win in the wood is worthily yours;<br/>
and whatever here you achieve, exchange me for it.<br/>
Sweet sir, swap we so – swear it in truth –<br/>
whether, lord, that way lies worse or better.’<br/>
‘By God,’ quoth Gawain the good, ‘I grant it you,<br/>
and that you lust for to play, like it methinks.’<br/>
‘Who’ll bring us a beverage, this bargain to make?’<br/>
so said the lord of that land. They laughed each one,<br/>
they drank and dallied and dealt in trifles,<br/>
these lords and ladies, as long as they liked;<br/>
and then with Frankish faring, full of fair words,<br/>
they stopped and stood and softly spoke,<br/>
kissing full comely and taking their leave.<br/>
By many lively servants with flaming torches,<br/>
each brave man was brought to his bed at last<br/>
                    full soft.<br/>
          To bed yet ere they sped,<br/>
          repeating the contract oft;<br/>
          the old lord of that spread<br/>
          could keep a game aloft.<br/></p>
                         <h3 id="III">III</h3><br/>
<p>
                             

Full early before the day the folk were risen;<br/>
Guests who would go their grooms they called on,<br/>
and they busied them briskly the beasts to saddle,<br/>
tightening their tackle, trussing their baggage.<br/>
The richest ready themselves to ride all arrayed,<br/>
leaping up lightly, latched onto their bridles,<br/>
each rode out by the way that he most liked.<br/>
The beloved lord of the land was not the last<br/>
arrayed for the riding, with ranks full many;<br/>
ate a sop hastily, when he had heard Mass,<br/>
with horns to the hunting field he hastens away.<br/>
By the time that daylight gleamed upon earth,<br/>
he with his knights on high horses were.<br/>
Then the cunning hunters coupled their hounds,<br/>
unclosed the kennel door and called them out,<br/>
blew briskly on their bugles three bare notes;<br/>
braches bayed therefore, and bold noise made,<br/>
and men chastised and turned those that chasing went,<br/>
a hundred of hunters, as I have heard tell,<br/>
                    of the best.<br/>
          To station, keepers strode,<br/>
          huntsmen leashes off-cast;<br/>
          great rumpus in that wood<br/>
          there rose with their good blasts.<br/></p>
<p>                             

At the first call of the quest quaked the wild;<br/>
deer drove for the dales, darting for dread,<br/>
hied to the high ground, but swiftly they were<br/>
stayed by the beaters, with their stout cries.<br/>
They let the harts with high branched heads have way,<br/>
the brave bucks also with their broad antlers;<br/>
for the noble lord had bidden that in close season<br/>
no man there should meddle with those male deer.<br/>
The hinds were held back with a ‘Hey’ and a ‘Ware!’<br/>
The does driven with great din to the deep coves.<br/>
There might men see, as they loosed, the slanting of arrows;<br/>
at each winding of the wood whistled a flight,<br/>
that bit into brown flanks, with broad blade-heads.<br/>
What screaming and bleeding, by banks they lay dying,<br/>
and ever the hounds in a rush hard on them followed,<br/>
hunters with high horn-calls hastened them after,<br/>
with such a crack and cry as cliffs were bursting.<br/>
What wild beasts so escaped the men shooting<br/>
were all dragged down and rent by the new reserves,<br/>
when hunted from high ground, and harried to water.<br/>
The lads were so skilled at the lower stations,<br/>
and the greyhounds so great, that gripped so quickly<br/>
and dragged them down, as swift I swear,<br/>
                    as sight.<br/>
          In bliss without alloy<br/>
          the lord does spur or alight,<br/>
          and passes that day with joy<br/>
          and so to the dark night.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Thus larks the lord by linden-wood eaves,<br/>
while Gawain the good man gaily abed lies,<br/>
lurks till the daylight gleams on the walls,<br/>
under canopy full clear, curtained about.<br/>
And as in slumber he lay, softly he heard<br/>
a little sound at his door, and it slid open;<br/>
and he heaves up his head out of the clothes,<br/>
a corner of the curtain he caught up a little,<br/>
and watches warily to make out what it might be.<br/>
It was the lady, the loveliest to behold,<br/>
that drew the door after her full silent and still,<br/>
and bent her way to the bed; and the knight ashamed,<br/>
laid him down again lightly and feigned to sleep.<br/>
And she stepped silently and stole to his bed,<br/>
caught up the curtain and crept within,<br/>
and sat her full softly on the bedside<br/>
and lingered there long, to look when he wakened.<br/>
The lord lay low, lurked a full long while,<br/>
compassing in his conscience what this case might<br/>
mean or amount to, marvelling in thought.<br/>
But yet he said to himself: ‘More seemly it were<br/>
to descry with speech, in a space, what she wishes.’<br/>
Then he wakened and wriggled and to her he turned,<br/>
and lifted his eyelids and let on he was startled,<br/>
and signed himself with his hand, as with prayer, to be<br/>
                    safer.<br/>
          With chin and cheek full sweet,<br/>
          both white and red together,<br/>
          full graciously did she greet,<br/>
          lips light with laughter.<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Good morning, Sir Gawain,’ said that sweet lady,<br/>
‘You are a sleeper unsafe, that one may slip hither.<br/>
Now are you taken in a trice, lest a truce we shape,<br/>
I shall bind you in your bed, that you may trust.’<br/>
All laughing the lady made her light jests.<br/>
‘Good morrow, sweet,’ quoth Gawain the blithe,<br/>
‘I shall work your will, and that I well like,<br/>
for I yield me swiftly and sue for grace;<br/>
and that is the best, to my mind, since behoves I must.’<br/>
And thus he jested again with much blithe laughter.<br/>
‘But would you, lovely lady, but grant me leave<br/>
and release your prisoner and pray him to rise,<br/>
I would bound from this bed and dress me better,<br/>
I should discover more comfort in speaking with you.’<br/>
‘Nay, forsooth, beau sire,’ said that sweet,<br/>
‘You shall not rise from your bed. I charge you better:<br/>
I shall wrap you up here on this other side,<br/>
and then chat with my knight whom I have caught;<br/>
for I know well, indeed, Sir Gawain you are,<br/>
that all the world worships, wherever you ride.<br/>
Your honour, your courtesy, is nobly praised<br/>
among lords, among ladies, all who life bear.<br/>
And now you are here, indeed, and we on our own;<br/>
my lord and his lords are far off faring,<br/>
other knights are abed, and my ladies also,<br/>
the door drawn and shut with a strong hasp.<br/>
And since I have in this house him who all like,<br/>
I shall work my time well, while it lasts,<br/>
                    with a tale.<br/>
          Your are welcome to my body,<br/>
          Your pleasure to take all;<br/>
          I must by necessity<br/>
          your servant be, and shall.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘In good faith,’ quoth Gawain, ‘a gain’s that me thinks,<br/>
though I be not now him of whom you are speaking;<br/>
to reach to such reverence as you rehearse here,<br/>
I am all ways unworthy, I know well myself.<br/>
By God, I’d be glad though if you thought it fit<br/>
in speech or service that I might set myself<br/>
to the pleasing of your worth – that were a pure joy.’<br/>
‘In good faith, Sir Gawain,’ quoth the sweet lady,<br/>
‘The worth and the prowess that pleases all others,<br/>
if I slighted or thought light of it, that were little grace;<br/>
but there are ladies enough that would far rather<br/>
have you, dear man, to hold, as I have you here,<br/>
to dally dearly in your delightful words,<br/>
comfort themselves and ease their cares,<br/>
than make much of the treasure and gold they have.<br/>
But as I love that same Lord that the heavens rules,<br/>
I have wholly in my hand what all desire<br/>
                    through grace.’<br/>
          She made him thus sweet cheer,<br/>
          who was so fair of face;<br/>
          the knight with speeches clear<br/>
          answered her every case.<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Madam,’ quoth the merry man, ‘Mary give you grace,<br/>
for I have found, in good faith, your friendship is noble.<br/>
Others gain full much of other folks praise for their deeds,<br/>
but the deference they deal me is undeserved in my case.<br/>
It is honour to you that naught but good you perceive.’<br/>
‘By Mary,’ quoth the lady, ‘methinks it otherwise;<br/>
for were I worth all the wonder of women alive,<br/>
and all the wealth of the world were in my hand,<br/>
and I should bargain to win myself a brave lord,<br/>
with the qualities that I know of you, knight, here,<br/>
of beauty and debonair and blithe seeming,<br/>
that I hearkened to ere now and have here found true,<br/>
then should no errant on earth before you be chosen.’<br/>
‘Indeed, lady,’ quoth the knight, ‘you have done much better;<br/>
but I am proud of the value you place on me,<br/>
and, solemnly your servant, my sovereign I hold you,<br/>
and your knight I become, and Christ reward you!’<br/>
Thus they mulled many matters till mid-morn passed,<br/>
and ever the lady let fall that she loved him much;<br/>
yet the knight held to his guard, and acted full fair.<br/>
‘Though I were loveliest lady,’ so her mind had it,<br/>
‘the less is there love in his load’ – for his fate he sought<br/>
                    that one,<br/>
          the stroke that should him cleave,<br/>
          and it must needs be done.<br/>
          The lady then sought to leave,<br/>
          he granting her that boon.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then she gave him good day, with a laughing glance,<br/>
and stunned him as she stood there, with cutting words:<br/>
‘May He who speeds each speech reward you this sport!<br/>
But that you should be Gawain, it baffles the mind.’<br/>
‘Wherefore?’ quoth the knight, and urgently asked,<br/>
fearful lest he had failed in forms of politeness.<br/>
But the lady blessed him and spoke as follows:<br/>
‘One gracious as Gawain is rightly held to be,<br/>
with courtesy contained so clear in himself,<br/>
could not lightly have lingered so long with a lady,<br/>
but he had craved a kiss out of courtesy,<br/>
with some trifling touch at some tale’s end.’<br/>
Then quoth Gawain: ‘Indeed, let it be as you like;<br/>
I shall kiss at your command, as befits a knight,<br/>
and further, lest I displease you, so plead no more.’<br/>
She comes nearer at that, and catches him in her arms,<br/>
leans lovingly down, and the lord kisses.<br/>
They graciously commend to Christ one another;<br/>
and she goes out at the door with not a word more;<br/>
And he readies himself to rise and hurries anon,<br/>
calls to his chamberlain, chooses his clothes,<br/>
going forth, when he is ready, blithely to Mass.<br/>
And then he went to the noble meal that awaited,<br/>
and made merry all day till the moonrise,<br/>
                    at games.<br/>
          Was never knight fairer sung<br/>
          between two such noble dames,<br/>
          the elder and the young;<br/>
          much joy had they of the same.<br/></p>
<p>                             

And ever the lord of the land intent on his games,<br/>
hunted, in holts and heath, for barren hinds,<br/>
Such a sum he there slew by the set of sun,<br/>
of does and other deer, it were deemed a wonder.<br/>
Then fiercely they flocked in, folk at the last,<br/>
and quickly of the quenched deer a heap they made.<br/>
The noblest sped there with servants enough,<br/>
gathered the quarry greatest in flesh that were there,<br/>
and had them deftly undone as custom demands.<br/>
Some that were there searched them in assay,<br/>
and two fingers of fat they found on the feeblest.<br/>
Then they slit the slot, and seized the first stomach,<br/>
shaved it with sharp knives, and knotted the sheared.<br/>
Then lopped off the four limbs and rent off the hide,<br/>
next broke they the belly, the bowels out-taking,<br/>
deftly, lest they undid and destroyed the knot.<br/>
They gripped the gullet, and swiftly severed<br/>
the weasand from the windpipe and whipped out the guts.<br/>
Then sheared out the shoulders with their sharp knives,<br/>
hauled them through a little hole, left the sides whole.<br/>
Then they slit up the breast and broke it in twain.<br/>
And again at the gullet one then began<br/>
rending all readily right to the fork,<br/>
voiding the entrails, and verily thereafter<br/>
all the membranes by the ribs readily loosened.<br/>
So too they cleared to the backbone, rightly,<br/>
even down to the haunch that hangs from the same,<br/>
and heaved it all up whole and hewed it off there.<br/>
and that they properly call the numbles, I deem,<br/>
                    by kind.<br/>
          At the fork then of the thighs<br/>
          they loose the lappets behind;<br/>
          to hew it in two they hie,<br/>
          by the backbone it to unbind.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Both the head and the neck they hewed off then,<br/>
and after sundered the sides swift from the chine,<br/>
and the ravens’ fee they cast into a grove.<br/>
Then they skewered each thick flank by the ribs,<br/>
and hung each up by the hocks of the haunches,<br/>
every fellow taking his fee as it fell to him.<br/>
On a skin of the fair beast fed they their hounds<br/>
with the liver and lights, and the stomach lining,<br/>
and bread bathed in blood blent there among.<br/>
Boldly they blew the kill their hounds a-baying;<br/>
then rode home with the flesh tightly packed,<br/>
stalwartly sounding out many stout notes.<br/>
As the daylight was done, the company came<br/>
to the comely castle, where our knight bides<br/>
                    all still,<br/>
          in bliss by bright fire set.<br/>
          The lord is come from the hill;<br/>
          when Gawain with him is met,<br/>
          there they but joy as they will.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then the lord commanded all be summoned to the hall,<br/>
both the ladies, aloft, to descend with their maids.<br/>
Before all the folk on the floor, he bid men<br/>
verily his venison to bring there before him;<br/>
and all gaily in courtesy Gawain he called,<br/>
and tells over the tally of full fat beasts,<br/>
shows him the fine flesh shorn from the ribs.<br/>
‘How does this sport please you? Have I won praise?<br/>
Have I won thanks, thoroughly served by my craft?’<br/>
‘Yes, indeed,’ quoth the other, ‘here spoils are fairest<br/>
of all I have seen this seven-year in season of winter.’<br/>
‘And I give all this to you, Gawain,’ quoth the man then,<br/>
‘for according to covenant you may call it your own.’<br/>
‘That is so,’ quoth the knight, ‘I say you the same:<br/>
what I have worthily won this house within,<br/>
shall with as good a will be worthily yours.’<br/>
And he clasps his fair neck his arms within,<br/>
and kisses him in as comely a way as he can:<br/>
‘Take you there my prize, I received no more;<br/>
I would grant it all, though it were greater.’<br/>
‘That is good,’ quoth the lord, ‘many thanks therefore.<br/>
This may be the better gift, if you would tell me<br/>
where you won this same prize by your own wits.’<br/>
‘That was not pledged,’ quoth he, ‘ask me no more;<br/>
for you have taken what’s due, none other to you<br/>
I owe.’<br/>
          They laughed and made blithe<br/>
          with words worth praise, and so<br/>
          to supper then side by side,<br/>
          with dainties in plenty go.<br/></p>
<p>                             

And then by the chimney in chamber sitting,<br/>
servants brought to them choice wines oft,<br/>
and in their banter they agreed in that morn<br/>
to fulfil the same bond they had made before:<br/>
what chance might betide, their prize to exchange,<br/>
each new thing they named, at night when they met.<br/>
They made accord of this covenant before all the court;<br/>
and beverage was brought forth in banter at this time.<br/>
Then they lovingly took their leave at the last,<br/>
each man at his leaving going brisk to his bed.<br/>
When the cock had crowed and cackled but thrice,<br/>
the lord leapt from his bed, the liegemen each one,<br/>
so that meat and a Mass were swiftly delivered,<br/>
the company off to the wood, ere daylight sprang,<br/>
                    to the chase.<br/>
          Proudly with huntsmen and horns<br/>
          through wilds they passed apace,<br/>
          uncoupled among the thorns,<br/>
          the hounds ran headlong race.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Soon they called for a search by the marsh-side,<br/>
the huntsman urged on the first hounds up,<br/>
wild cries he uttered with wondrous noise.<br/>
The hounds that heard him hastened there swiftly,<br/>
and fell as fast to the trail, forty at once.<br/>
Then such a baying and clamour of gathered hounds<br/>
rose that the rocks rang out all about.<br/>
Huntsmen harried them with horn and by mouth;<br/>
then all in a pack they swung together<br/>
between a pool in that place and a cruel crag.<br/>
On a knoll by a cliff, at the marsh side,<br/>
where the rough rock had ruggedly fallen,<br/>
they sped to the finding, the huntsmen after.<br/>
They surrounded the crag and the knoll both,<br/>
while they made sure they had well within<br/>
the beast that was bayed at, there, by their bloodhounds.<br/>
Then they beat at the bushes and bade him rise up,<br/>
and he savagely swung athwart the huntsmen –<br/>
a most splendid boar it was, rushed out there,<br/>
solitary through age, long split from the herd,<br/>
but he was still mighty, the greatest of boars,<br/>
full grim when he grunted. Then grieved many<br/>
for three hounds at first thrust he felled to the earth,<br/>
and sped him forth at great speed all unscathed.<br/>
The hunt hallooed ‘Hi!’ full loud, and cried ‘Hey! Hey!<br/>
and horns to mouths, hastily recalled them.<br/>
Many were the merry cries of men and of hounds<br/>
that brisk chased the boar, with barking and clamour,<br/>
                    to quell,<br/>
          Full oft he bides at bay<br/>
          and downs the dogs pell-mell;<br/>
          he harries the hounds, and they<br/>
          full piteously yowl and yell.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Shaping to shoot him some shoved through then,<br/>
hurling their arrows at him, hitting him often;<br/>
but their points were parried by bristling flanks,<br/>
and their barbs would not bite there in his brow,<br/>
though the smooth shaft were shattered in pieces,<br/>
the head skipped away wherever it hit.<br/>
but when by dint of dire strokes they damaged him,<br/>
then, maddened by baiting, he rushes the men,<br/>
hurts them full heavily as forth he hies,<br/>
and many were awed at that and drew backwards.<br/>
But the lord on a lithe horse lunges after him,<br/>
as knight bold in the battle his bugle he blows,<br/>
rallied the hounds as he rode through rank thicket,<br/>
pursuing this wild swine till the sun had set.<br/>
The day with these same deeds they passed in this wise,<br/>
while our courteous knight lay in his bed,<br/>
Gawain gladly at home, in gear full rich<br/>
                    of hue.<br/>
          The lady did not forget,<br/>
          to come to greet him too;<br/>
          full early she him beset<br/>
          to seek a change of mood.<br/></p>
<p>                             

She came to the curtain and peeped at the knight.<br/>
Sir Gawain welcomed her courteously first,<br/>
and she answered him again eager her words,<br/>
sits herself soft by his side, and sweetly she laughs,<br/>
and with a loving look she led with these words:<br/>
‘Sir, if you be Gawain, it’s a wonder methinks,<br/>
why one so well disposed always to good,<br/>
knows not how to manage his manners in company,<br/>
and if any teach you to know them, you cast them from mind.<br/>
You have swiftly forgot what but yesterday I taught<br/>
with all the truest tokens of talk that I could.’<br/>
‘What is that?’ quoth the knight, ‘Indeed I know not.<br/>
If it be truth that you breathe, the blame is mine own.’<br/>
‘Yet I taught you of kissing.’ quoth the fair dame,<br/>
‘where countenance is fair, quick make your claim;<br/>
that becomes every knight that courtesy uses.’<br/>
‘Unsay,’ quoth that brave man, ‘my dear, that speech,<br/>
for that I dare not do, lest I were denied;<br/>
if I were spurned, I’d be wrong, indeed, to have proffered.’<br/>
‘By my faith,’ quoth the lady, ‘you cannot be spurned;<br/>
you are strong enough to constrain by strength, if you like,<br/>
if any were so villainous as to deny you.’<br/>
‘Yes, by God,’ quoth Gawain, ‘true is your speech,<br/>
but threats do never thrive in the land where I live,<br/>
nor any gift that is given without a good will.<br/>
I am at your command, to kiss when you like;<br/>
you may lip when you will, and leave when you wish<br/>
                    in a space.’<br/>
          The lady bends her adown<br/>
          and sweetly she kisses his face;<br/>
          much speech they there expound<br/>
          of love, its grief and grace.<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘I would know of you, knight,’ that lady then said,<br/>
‘if you are not angered by this, what is the reason<br/>
that so young and lively a one as you at this time,<br/>
so courteous, so knightly, as widely you’re known<br/>
(and from all chivalry to choose, the chief things praised<br/>
are the laws of loyal love, and the lore of arms;<br/>
for in telling those tales of the truest of knights,<br/>
all the title and text of their works is taken<br/>
from how lords hazard their lives for loyal love,<br/>
endured for that duty’s sake dreadful trials,<br/>
and after with valour avenged, and void their cares,<br/>
brought bliss to the bower by bounties their own)<br/>
and you, the knight, the noblest child of your age,<br/>
your high fame and honour told everywhere,<br/>
why I have sat by yourself here separately twice,<br/>
yet heard I never that your head held even a word<br/>
that ever belonged to love, the less nor the more.<br/>
And you, that are so courteous and coy of your vows,<br/>
ought, to a young thing, to yearn to show<br/>
and teach some tokens of true love’s craft<br/>
What! Are you ignorant, who garner all praise,<br/>
or else do you deem me too dull to heed your dalliance?<br/>
                    For shame!<br/>
          I come hither single and sit<br/>
          to learn of you some game;<br/>
          do teach me of your wit,<br/>
          while my lord is away.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘In good faith,’ quoth Gawain, ‘may God reward you!<br/>
Great is the gladness, and pleasure to me,<br/>
that so worthy as you should wind her way hither,<br/>
at pains with so poor a man as to sport with your knight<br/>
with any show of favour – it sets me at ease.<br/>
But to take on the travail myself of expounding true love,<br/>
and touch on the themes of the texts and tales of arms<br/>
to you who, I know well, wield more skill<br/>
in that art, by half, than a hundred of such<br/>
as I am or ever shall be, on this earth where I live –<br/>
that were a manifold folly, my dear, by my troth.<br/>
I would your wishes work if ever I might,<br/>
as I am highly beholden, and evermore will<br/>
be servant to yourself, so save me God!’<br/>
Thus that lady framed her questions and tempted him oft,<br/>
for to win him to woe, whatever else she thought of;<br/>
but he defended himself so fairly no fault it seemed,<br/>
no evil on either hand, nor did they know aught<br/>
                    but bliss.<br/>
          They laughed and larked full long;<br/>
          at the last she did him kiss,<br/>
          farewell was on her tongue,<br/>
          and went her way, with this.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then bestirs him the knight and rises for Mass,<br/>
and then the dinner was done and duly served.<br/>
The knight with the ladies larked all day,<br/>
but the lord of the land gallops full oft,<br/>
hunts the ill-fated swine, that surges by banks<br/>
and bites the best of his hounds’ backs asunder<br/>
biding at bay, till bowmen bettered him,<br/>
made him head for the open, for all he could do,<br/>
so fast flew the arrows where those folk gathered.<br/>
But yet at times the bravest he made to start,<br/>
till at the last so weary he was he could not run,<br/>
but, with best haste he might, to a hole he wins<br/>
in the bank, by a rock where runs the burn.<br/>
He got the bank at his back, began to scrape,<br/>
the froth foamed from his mouth foul at the corners,<br/>
and he whet his white tusks. It was irksome then<br/>
to the all the beaters so bold that by him stood<br/>
to harass him from afar, but nigh him no man<br/>
                    dared go.<br/>
          He had hurt so many before<br/>
          that all were then full loath<br/>
          to be torn by his tusks once more,<br/>
          that was fierce and frenzied both.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Till the lord came himself, urged on his horse,<br/>
saw the boar bide at bay, his men beside.<br/>
He alights lively adown, leaves his courser,<br/>
brings out a bright blade and boldly strides forth,<br/>
fast through the ford, where the fell foe bides.<br/>
The wild beast was wary of one with a weapon in hand,<br/>
his bristles rose high, so fiercely he snorts<br/>
that folk feared for the lord, lest worst him befell.<br/>
The swine straight away set on the man,<br/>
that the baron and boar were both in a heap,<br/>
in the white water. The worst had the creature,<br/>
For the man marked him well, as they first met,<br/>
set the sharp point firm in its chest-hollow,<br/>
hit him up to the hilt, so the heart burst asunder,<br/>
and he yielded him snarling, downstream was swept<br/>
outright.<br/>
          A hundred hounds him rent,<br/>
          that bravely could him bite;<br/>
          beaters brought him to bank<br/>
          and the dogs to death, in fight.<br/></p>
<p>                             

There was blowing the kill on many brave horns,<br/>
hallooing on high as loud as men might;<br/>
Hounds bayed at the beast, as bid by their masters,<br/>
who of that hard chase were the chief huntsmen.<br/>
Then a man who was wisest in woodcraft<br/>
with loving care to undo the beast begins:<br/>
first he hews off his head and sets it on high,<br/>
then rends him roughly along the ridge of his back,<br/>
brings out the bowels, and broils them on coals,<br/>
with bread blent therewith his hounds rewards.<br/>
Then he breaks out the brawn in broad bright slabs,<br/>
and has out the entrails, as is seemly and right;<br/>
attaches the two halves wholly together,<br/>
and then on a strong stake stoutly them hangs.<br/>
Now with this same swine they set off for home;<br/>
the boar’s head was borne before the baron himself,<br/>
who felled him down by the ford through force of his hand<br/>
                    so strong.<br/>
          Till he saw Sir Gawain<br/>
          in the hall it seemed full long;<br/>
          he calls, and he comes again<br/>
          for the dues that to him belong.<br/></p>
<p>                             

The lord, full loud he cried, laughed merrily<br/>
when he saw Sir Gawain; and with joy he speaks.<br/>
The good ladies were summoned, the household gathered;<br/>
he shows him the boar’s sides, and shapes him the tale<br/>
of the largeness and length, the malignity also,<br/>
of the war on the wild swine in woods where he fled.<br/>
So the other knight full nobly commended his deeds,<br/>
and praised it, the great merit that he had proved;<br/>
for such brawn from a beast, the brave knight said,<br/>
nor such flanks on a swine he’d not seen before.<br/>
Then they handled the huge head, the knight gave praise,<br/>
and showed horror at it, for the lord to hear.<br/>
‘Now Gawain,’ quoth the good man, ‘this game is your own,<br/>
by a firm and fast promise, as in faith you know.’<br/>
‘That is true,’ quoth the knight, ‘and as surely true<br/>
is that all I got I shall give you again, by my troth.’<br/>
He clasped the lord at the neck and gently kissed him,<br/>
and after that of the same he again served him there.<br/>
‘Now are we even quit,’ quoth the knight, ‘this eventide,<br/>
of all the covenants made here, since I came hither,<br/>
                    by law.’<br/>
          The lord said: ‘By Saint Giles,<br/>
          you are the best that I know;<br/>
          you’ll be rich in a while,<br/>
          if your trade continues so.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then they set up tables on trestles aloft,<br/>
casting cloths on them. Clear light then<br/>
wakened the walls, waxen torches<br/>
servants set, and served food all about.<br/>
Much gladness and glee gushed out therein<br/>
round the fire on the floor, and in fulsome wise<br/>
at the supper and after, many noble songs,<br/>
such as Christmas carols and dances new,<br/>
with all manner of mirth that man may tell of,<br/>
and ever our courteous knight the lady beside.<br/>
Such sweetness to that man she showed all seemly,<br/>
with secret stolen glances, that stalwart knight to please,<br/>
that all wondering was the man, and wrath with himself;<br/>
but he could not out of breeding spurn her advances,<br/>
but dealt with her daintily, howsoever the deed might<br/>
                    be cast.<br/>
          When they had dallied in hall<br/>
          as long as their will might last,<br/>
          to chamber the lord him called,<br/>
          and to the hearth they passed.<br/></p>
<p>                             

And there they drank and debated and decided anew<br/>
to act on the same terms on New Year’s Eve;<br/>
but the knight craved leave to go forth on the morn,<br/>
for it was nearing the time when he must go.<br/>
The lord persuaded him not to, pressed him to linger,<br/>
and said: ‘As I am true, I pledge you my troth<br/>
you shall gain the Green Chapel, and render your dues,<br/>
sir, by New Year’s light, long before prime.<br/>
And so go lie in your room and take your ease,<br/>
and I shall hunt in the holt and hold to the covenant,<br/>
exchanging what has chanced, when I spur hither;<br/>
for I have tested you twice, and faithful I find you.<br/>
Now:  “third time pays all,” think on that tomorrow;<br/>
Make we merry while we may, and mind only joy,<br/>
for a man may find sorrow whenever he likes.’<br/>
This was graciously granted and Gawain lingered;<br/>
Blithely they brought him drink, and bed-wards they went<br/>
                    with light.<br/>
          Sir Gawain lies down and sleeps<br/>
          full still and soft all night;<br/>
          the lord who to woodcraft keeps,<br/>
          rises early and bright.<br/></p>
<p>                             

After Mass a morsel he and his men took;<br/>
merry was the morning, his mount he summoned.<br/>
All the men that a-horse were followed him after,<br/>
ready set on their steeds before the hall gates.<br/>
Fairest of fair was the field, for the frost clung.<br/>
In red ruddiness on wrack rises the sun,<br/>
and, full clear, casts the clouds from the welkin.<br/>
Huntsmen unleashed the hounds by a holt side;<br/>
rocks in woods rang out with the cry of the horns.<br/>
some hounds fell to the track where the fox lurked,<br/>
oft traversing the trail by dint of their wiles.<br/>
A little one cried scent, the huntsman to him called;<br/>
his fellows fell to, panting full thick,<br/>
running forth in a rabble on the right track.<br/>
And fox frisked before them; they found him soon,<br/>
and when they had him in sight pursued him fast,<br/>
marking him clearly with wrathful noise;<br/>
and he twists and turns through many a tangled grove,<br/>
doubles back and hearkens by hedges full often.<br/>
At the last by a little ditch he leaps over a thicket,<br/>
steals out full silent by the side of a valley,<br/>
thinks to slip from the wood by guile, from the hounds.<br/>
Then he came, ere he knew it, to a fine hunt-station,<br/>
where three hounds in a cleft threaten him together,<br/>
                    all grey.<br/>
          There he started aside<br/>
          and boldly he did stray;<br/>
          with all the woe in life,<br/>
          to the wood he went away.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then was it lively delight to list to the hounds,<br/>
when all the meet had met him, mingled together.<br/>
Such curses at that sight rained down on his head<br/>
as if all the clinging cliffs clattered down in a heap.<br/>
Here was he hallooed when huntsmen met him,<br/>
loud was he greeted with snarling speech;<br/>
there he was threatened and called thief often,<br/>
and ever the hounds at his tail, that he might not tarry.<br/>
Oft he was rushed at when he made for the open,<br/>
and often swerved back again, so wily was Reynard.<br/>
and so he led them astray, the lord and his liegemen,<br/>
in this manner by mountains till after mid-morning,<br/>
while the honoured knight at home happily slept<br/>
within the comely curtains, on that cold morn.<br/>
But the lady for love could get no sleep,<br/>
nor could the purpose impair pitched in her heart,<br/>
but rose up swiftly, and took herself thither<br/>
in a merry mantle, that reached the earth,<br/>
that was furred full fine with purest pelts;<br/>
without coif on her head, but the noblest gems<br/>
traced about her hair-net by twenties in clusters;<br/>
her fair face and her throat shown all naked,<br/>
her breast bare before, and her back the same.<br/>
She came in by the chamber door and closed it after,<br/>
threw open a window and to the knight called,<br/>
and roundly thus rebuked him with her rich words<br/>
                    with cheer:<br/>
          ‘Ah! Man, how can you sleep?<br/>
          This morning is so clear.’<br/>
          He was in slumber deep,<br/>
          and yet he could her hear.<br/></p>
<p>                             

In heavy depths of dreaming murmured that noble,<br/>
as one that was troubled with thronging thoughts,<br/>
of how destiny would that day deal him his fate<br/>
at the Green Chapel, where he must meet his man,<br/>
bound there to bear his buffet without more debate.<br/>
But when he had fully recovered his wits,<br/>
he started from dreaming and answered in haste.<br/>
The lovely lady with laughter so sweet,<br/>
bent over his fair face and fully him kissed.<br/>
He welcomed her worthily with noble cheer;<br/>
he saw her so glorious and gaily attired,<br/>
so faultless of feature and of such fine hue,<br/>
bright welling joy warmed all his heart.<br/>
With sweet smiling softly they slip into mirth,<br/>
that to all bliss and beauty, that breaks between them,<br/>
                    they win.<br/>
          They spoke in words full good,<br/>
          much pleasure was therein;<br/>
          in great peril would have stood,<br/>
          kept not Mary her knight from sin.<br/></p>
<p>                             

For that peerless princess pressed him so closely,<br/>
urged him so near the edge, he felt it behoved him<br/>
either to bow to her love, or with loathing refuse her.<br/>
He cared for his courtesy, lest he were churlish,<br/>
and more for the mischief if he should work sin<br/>
and be traitor to that lord who held the dwelling.<br/>
‘God shield us!’ quoth the knight, ‘that must not befall!’<br/>
With loving laughter a little he put aside<br/>
all the special pleading that sprang from her mouth.<br/>
Quoth beauty to the brave: ‘Blame you deserve,<br/>
if you love not that live lady that you lie next,<br/>
who above all of the world is wounded in heart,<br/>
unless you have a leman, a lover, that you like better,<br/>
and firm of faith to that fair one, fastened so hard<br/>
that you list not to loose it – and that I believe.<br/>
If that you tell me that truly, I pray you;<br/>
by all the lovers alive, hide not the truth<br/>
                    with guile.’<br/>
          The knight said: ‘By Saint John,’<br/>
          and gentle was his smile<br/>
          ‘In faith I love no one,<br/>
          nor none will love the while.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘These words,’ said the lady, ‘are the worst words of all;<br/>
but I am answered forsooth, so that it grieves me.<br/>
Kiss me now gently, and I shall go hence;<br/>
I may but mourn upon earth, a maid that loves much.’<br/>
Sighing she stooped down, and sweetly him kissed,<br/>
and then she severs from him, and says as she stands:<br/>
‘Now, dear, at this our parting set me at ease:<br/>
give me something, a gift, if only your glove,<br/>
that I may think of you, man, my mourning to lessen.’<br/>
‘Now indeed,’ quoth the knight, ‘I would I had here<br/>
the dearest thing, for your sake, I own in the world,<br/>
for you have deserved, forsooth, and in excess,<br/>
a richer reward, by rights, than I might reckon;<br/>
but as a love-token, this would profit you little.<br/>
It is not to your honour to have at this time<br/>
a glove of Gawain’s giving to treasure;<br/>
and I am here on an errand in lands unknown,<br/>
and have no servants with sacks of precious things.<br/>
I dislike this, my lady, for your sake, at this time;<br/>
but each man must do as he must, take it not ill<br/>
                    nor pine.’<br/>
           ‘Nay, knight of high honours,’<br/>
          quoth that love-some lady fine,<br/>
          ‘though I shall have naught of yours,<br/>
          yet shall you have of mine.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

She proffered him a rich ring of red gold work,<br/>
with a sparkling stone glittering aloft,<br/>
that blazed brilliant beams like the bright sun;<br/>
know you well that it’s worth was full huge.<br/>
But the knight refused it and he readily said:<br/>
‘I’ll no gifts, before God, my dear, at this time;<br/>
I have none to give you, nor naught will I take.’<br/>
She offered it him eagerly, yet he her gift spurned,<br/>
and swore swiftly his oath that he would not seize it;<br/>
and she grieved he refused her, and said thereafter:<br/>
‘Since you reject my ring, too rich it may seem,<br/>
for you would not be so high beholden to me,<br/>
I shall give you my girdle: that profits you less.’<br/>
She loosed a belt lightly that lay round her sides,<br/>
looped over her kirtle beneath her bright mantle.<br/>
Gear it was of green silk and with gold trimmed,<br/>
at the edges embroidered, with finger-stitching;<br/>
and that she offered the knight, and blithely besought<br/>
that he would take it though it were unworthy.<br/>
but he said he might have nigh him in no wise<br/>
neither gold nor treasure, ere God sent him grace,<br/>
to achieve the errand he had chosen there.<br/>
‘And therefore, I pray you, be not displeased,<br/>
and let your gift go, for I swear it I can never<br/>
you grant.<br/>
          To you I am deeply beholden,<br/>
          your kindness is so pleasant,<br/>
          and ever in heat and cold, then<br/>
          I’ll be your true servant.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Now do you shun this silk,’ said the lady,<br/>
‘because it is simple in itself? And so it may seem.<br/>
Lo! It is slight indeed, and so is less worthy.<br/>
But whoso knew the worth woven therein<br/>
he would hold it in higher praise, perchance;<br/>
for whatever man is girt with this green lace,<br/>
while he has it closely fastened about him,<br/>
there is no man under heaven might hew him,<br/>
for he may not be slain by any sleight upon earth.’<br/>
Then the knight thought, and it came to his heart,<br/>
it was a jewel for the jeopardy judged upon him,<br/>
when he gained the Green Chapel, his fate to find;<br/>
if he might slip past un-slain, the sleight were noble.<br/>
Then he indulged her suit, and told her to speak.<br/>
And she pressed the belt on him urging it eagerly;<br/>
and he granted it, and she gave it him with goodwill,<br/>
and besought him, for her sake, never to reveal it,<br/>
but loyally conceal it from her lord. The knight agrees<br/>
that no one should know of it, indeed, but they two,<br/>
                    betimes.<br/>
          He thanked her as he might,<br/>
          with all his heart and mind.<br/>
          By then the gallant knight,<br/>
          she had kissed three times.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then took she her leave and left him there,<br/>
for more of that man she might not get.<br/>
When she is gone, Sir Gawain attires himself,<br/>
rises and dresses himself in noble array,<br/>
lays aside the love-lace the lady gave him,<br/>
hides it full handily where he might find it.<br/>
Then swiftly to the chapel took he his way,<br/>
privately approached a priest, and there prayed him<br/>
that he would enlighten his life and teach him better<br/>
how his soul might be saved when he went hence.<br/>
Then he shrove himself fully, eschewed his misdeeds<br/>
the major and minor, and mercy beseeches,<br/>
and calls on the priest for absolution;<br/>
and he absolved him surely and left him so pure<br/>
that Doomsday yet might be declared on the morn.<br/>
And then he made himself merry among the fair ladies,<br/>
with comely carols and all manner of joy,<br/>
more than ever before that day, till the dark night,<br/>
                    in bliss.<br/>
          Each one had courtesy there<br/>
          of him, and said: ‘He is<br/>
          the merriest he was ever<br/>
          since he came hither, ere this.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

Now long in that leisure there let him abide!<br/>
Yet is the lord on his land, pursuing his sport.<br/>
He has done for the fox that he followed so long.<br/>
As he spurred through a spinney to spy the shrew,<br/>
there where he heard the hounds harry him on,<br/>
Reynard came rushing through the rough grove,<br/>
and all the rabble in a race, right at his heels.<br/>
The lord, aware of the wild thing, warily waits,<br/>
and brandishes his bright blade, drives at the beast.<br/>
And it shunned the sharp edge and sought to retreat;<br/>
but a hound rushed at him, before ere he might,<br/>
and right before the horse’s feet they fell on him all<br/>
and worried the wily one with a wrathful noise.<br/>
The lord swiftly alighted then and latched on,<br/>
raised him full suddenly out of the ravening mouths,<br/>
holds him high over his head, halloos full loud,<br/>
while there bayed at him many brave hounds.<br/>
Huntsmen hied them thither with horns full many,<br/>
sounding the rally aright till they saw their lord.<br/>
When his noble company had all come in,<br/>
all that ever bore bugle blew at once,<br/>
and all the others hallooed who had no horn.<br/>
It was the merriest meet that ever men heard,<br/>
the ripe roar raised there for Reynard’s soul from every<br/>
                    man’s throat.<br/>
          Their hounds they then reward,<br/>
          Their heads they fondle and stroke;<br/>
          and then they take Reynard<br/>
          and strip him of his coat.<br/></p>
<p>                             

And then they hurry for home, for it was nigh night,<br/>
striking up strongly on their stout horns.<br/>
The lord alights at last at his much-loved home,<br/>
finds fire upon hearth, the knight there beside,<br/>
Sir Gawain the good who glad was withal –<br/>
for among the ladies he was joyfully beloved.<br/>
He wore a gown of blue that reached to the ground.<br/>
His surcoat suited him well, all soft with fur,<br/>
and his hood of the same hung from his shoulder,<br/>
trimmed all with ermine were both all about.<br/>
He met with the lord in the midst of the floor,<br/>
and all with joy did him greet, and gladly he said:<br/>
‘I shall fulfil the first our contract now,<br/>
that we settled so speedily sparing no drink.’<br/>
Then he clasped the lord and kissed him thrice,<br/>
as strongly and steadily as he well could.<br/>
‘By Christ,’ quoth the other, ‘you’ve found much luck<br/>
in transacting this trade, if your profit was good.’<br/>
‘You need not care about profit,’ quick quoth the other,<br/>
‘as I’ve promptly paid over the profit I took.’<br/>
‘Marry,’ quoth the other, ‘my own falls behind,<br/>
for I have hunted all this day, and naught have I got<br/>
but this foul fox fell – the fiend take such goods! –<br/>
and that’s a poor price to pay for such precious things<br/>
as you so have given me here, three such kisses<br/>
                    so good.’<br/>
          ‘Enough,’ quoth Sir Gawain,<br/>
          ‘I thank you, by the Rood.’<br/>
          And how the fox was slain<br/>
          the lord told as they stood.<br/></p>
<p>                             </p>
<p>With mirth and minstrelsy, with meals at will,<br/>
they made as merry as any men might,<br/>
with laughter of ladies, and jesting with words.<br/>
Gawain and the good man so glad are they both:<br/>
must be, lest the diners are drunkards or dotards.<br/>
Both master and men played many jokes,<br/>
till the time it was come that they must sever;<br/>
his men at the last must go to their beds.<br/>
Then humbly his leave of the lord at first<br/>
takes the noble knight, and fairly him thanks:<br/>
‘For such a splendid sojourn as I have had here,<br/>
your honour at this high feast, the High King reward you!<br/>
I would give myself as one of your men, if you so like;<br/>
but I must needs, as you know, move on tomorrow,<br/>
if you’ll grant me a guide to show, as you promised,<br/>
the way to the Green Chapel, as God wills for me<br/>
to be dealt on New Year’s day the doom my fate brings.’<br/>
‘In good faith,’ quoth the good man, ‘by my goodwill<br/>
all that ever I promised you, I shall hold ready.’<br/>
Then he assigned him a servant to show him the way<br/>
and conduct him through the hills, so he’d not delay,<br/>
and faring through forest and thickset the shortest way<br/>
                    he’d weave.<br/>
          The lord Gawain did thank,<br/>
          such honour he did receive.<br/>
          Then of the ladies of rank<br/>
          the knight must take his leave.<br/></p>
<p>                             

With sad care and kissing he spoke to them still,<br/>
and full heartfelt thanks he pressed on them:<br/>
and they yielded him again replies the same,<br/>
commending him to Christ then with frozen sighs.<br/>
So from the company he courteously parts;<br/>
each man that he met, he gave him his thanks<br/>
for his service and for the solicitous care<br/>
that they had shown busied about him in serving;<br/>
and all were as sorry to sever from him there<br/>
as if they had dwelt nobly with that knight ever.<br/>
Then the lads with lights led him to his chamber,<br/>
and blithely brought him to bed to be at his rest.<br/>
If he did not sleep soundly, I dare say nothing,<br/>
for he had much on the morrow to mind, if he would,<br/>
                    in thought.<br/>
          Let him lie there quite still,<br/>
          he is near what he sought;<br/>
          and quiet you a while until<br/>
          I tell you of all that they wrought.<br/></p>
                         <h3 id="IV">IV</h3><br/>

                             
 <p><br/>
Now nears the New Year and the night passes,<br/>
the day drives away dark, as the Deity bids.<br/>
But wild weather awoke in the world outside,<br/>
clouds cast cold keenly down to the earth,<br/>
with wind enough from the north, to flail the flesh.<br/>
The snow sleeted down sharp, and nipped the wild;<br/>
the whistling wind wailed from the heights<br/>
and drove each dale full of drifts full great.<br/>
The knight listened full well, as he lay in his bed.<br/>
Though he closes his lids, full little he sleeps;<br/>
with each cock that crew he well knew his tryst.<br/>
Deftly he dressed himself, ere the day sprang,<br/>
for there was a lighted lamp gleamed in his chamber.<br/>
He called to his servant who promptly replied,<br/>
and bade him bring coat of mail and saddle his mount;<br/>
the man rises up and fetches him his clothes,<br/>
and attires Sir Gawain in splendid style.<br/>
First he clad him in clothes to ward off the cold,<br/>
and then in his harness, that burnished was kept,<br/>
both his belly-armour and plate, polished full bright,<br/>
the rings of his rich mail-coat rubbed free of rust;<br/>
and all was as fresh as at first, and he to give thanks<br/>
                    was glad.<br/>
          He had put on each piece<br/>
          and in bright armour clad ;<br/>
          fairest from here to Greece,<br/>
          his steed to be brought he bade.<br/></p>
<p>                             

While he wound himself in the most splendid weeds –<br/>
his coat-armour with its badge of clear deeds,<br/>
set out upon velvet, with virtuous stones<br/>
embellished and bound about it, embroidered seams,<br/>
and fair lined within with fine furs –<br/>
yet he forgot not the lace, the lady’s gift;<br/>
that Gawain did not fail of, for his own good.<br/>
when he had bound the blade on his smooth haunches,<br/>
then he wound the love-token twice him about,<br/>
swiftly swathed it about his waist sweetly that knight.<br/>
The girdle of green silk that gallant well suited,<br/>
upon that royal red cloth that rich was to show.<br/>
But it was not for its richness he wore this girdle,<br/>
nor for pride in the pendants, though polished they were,<br/>
and though the glittering gold gleamed at the ends,<br/>
but to save himself when it behoved him to suffer,<br/>
to abide baneful stroke without battling with blade<br/>
                    or knife.<br/>
          With that the knight all sound,<br/>
          goes swift to risk his life;<br/>
          all the men of renown<br/>
          he thanks, prepares for strife.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then was Gringolet readied, that was huge and great,<br/>
and had been stabled snugly and in secure wise;<br/>
he was eager to gallop, that proud horse then.<br/>
The knight went to him and gazed at his coat,<br/>
and said soberly to himself, and swore by the truth:<br/>
‘Here are many, in this motte, that of honour think.<br/>
The man who maintains it, joy may he have!<br/>
The fair lady through life may love her befall!<br/>
Thus if they for charity cherish a guest,<br/>
and hold honour in their hand, the Lord them reward<br/>
who upholds the heavens on high, and also you all!<br/>
And if I should live for any while upon earth,<br/>
I would grant you some reward readily, if I might.’<br/>
Then steps he into the stirrup and strides aloft.<br/>
His man showed him his shield; on shoulder he slung it,<br/>
gives spur to Gringolet with his gilded heels,<br/>
and he starts forth on the stones – pausing no longer<br/>
                    to prance.<br/>
          His servant to horse got then,<br/>
          who bore his spear and lance.<br/>
          ‘This castle to Christ I commend:<br/>
          May he grant it good chance!’<br/></p>
<p>                             

The drawbridge was let down, and the broad gates<br/>
unbarred and flung open upon both sides.<br/>
The knight blessed himself swiftly, and passed the boards;<br/>
praised the porter kneeling before the prince,<br/>
who gives him God and good-day, that Gawain He save;<br/>
and goes on his way with his one man,<br/>
who shall teach him the path to that perilous place<br/>
where the grievous blow he shall receive.<br/>
They brushed by banks where boughs were bare,<br/>
they climbed by cliffs where clung the cold.<br/>
the heavens were up high, but ugly there-under<br/>
mist moved on the moors, melted on mountains,<br/>
each hill had a hat, a mist-mantle huge.<br/>
Brooks boiled and broke their banks about,<br/>
sheer shattering on shores where they down-flowed.<br/>
Well wild was the way where they by woods rode,<br/>
till it was soon time that the sun in that season<br/>
                    does rise.<br/>
          They were on a hill full high,<br/>
          the white snow lay beside;<br/>
          the man that rode him by<br/>
          bade his master abide.<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘For I have brought you hither, sir, at this time,<br/>
and now you are not far from that noted place<br/>
that you have sought and spurred so specially after.<br/>
But I must say, forsooth, that since I know you,<br/>
and you are a lord full of life whom I well love,<br/>
if you would hark to my wit, you might do better.<br/>
The place that you pace to full perilous is held;<br/>
there lives a man in that waste, the worst upon earth,<br/>
for he is strong and stern and loves to strike,<br/>
and more man he is than any upon middle-earth,<br/>
and his body bigger than the best four<br/>
that are in Arthur’s house, Hector, or others.<br/>
He makes it so to chance at the Green Chapel,<br/>
that none passes by that place so proud in arms<br/>
that he but does him to death by dint of his hand;<br/>
for he is a mighty man, and shows no mercy,<br/>
for be it churl or chaplain that rides by the chapel,<br/>
monk or priest of the Mass, or any man else,<br/>
he is as quick to kill him, as to live himself.<br/>
Therefore I say, as true as you sit in the saddle,<br/>
come there, and you will be killed, if he has his way,<br/>
trust me truly in that, though you had twenty lives<br/>
                    to spend.<br/>
          He has lived here of yore,<br/>
          and battled to great extent.<br/>
          Against his blows full sore,<br/>
          you may not yourself defend.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Therefore, good Sir Gawain, let him alone,<br/>
and go by some other way, for God’s own sake!<br/>
Course some other country where Christ might you speed.<br/>
And I shall hie me home again, and undertake<br/>
that I shall swear by God and all his good saints –<br/>
so help me God and the Holy things, and oaths enough –<br/>
that I shall loyally keep your secret, and loose no tale<br/>
that ever you fled from any man that I know of.’<br/>
‘Grant merci,’ quoth Gawain, and galled he said:<br/>
‘It is worthy of you, man, to wish for my good,<br/>
and loyally keep my secret I know that you would.<br/>
But, keep it ever so quiet, if I passed here,<br/>
and fled away in fear, in the form that you tell of,<br/>
I were a cowardly knight, I might not be excused.<br/>
For I will go to the chapel, whatever chance may befall,<br/>
and talk with that same fellow in whatever way I wish,<br/>
whether it’s weal or woe, as fate may to me<br/>
                    behave.<br/>
          Though he be a stern fellow<br/>
          to manage, armed with a stave,<br/>
          full well does the Lord know<br/>
          His servants how to save.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Marry!’ quoth the other man, ‘now you spell it out<br/>
that you will take all your own trouble on yourself,<br/>
if you will lose your life, I’ll not you delay.<br/>
Have your helm here on your head, your spear in your hand,<br/>
and ride down this same track by yon rock side,<br/>
till you’re brought to the bottom of the wild valley,<br/>
then look a little on the level, to your left hand,<br/>
and you shall see in that vale that selfsame chapel<br/>
and the burly giant on guard that it keeps.<br/>
Now farewell, in God’s name, Gawain the noble!<br/>
For all the gold in the ground I’d not go with you,<br/>
nor bear fellowship through this forest one foot further.’<br/>
With that the man in the wood tugs at his bridle,<br/>
hits his horse with his heels as hard as he might,<br/>
leaps away over the land, and leaves the knight there<br/>
                    alone.<br/>
          ‘By God’s self,’ quoth Gawain,<br/>
          ‘I will neither weep nor groan;<br/>
          to God’s will I bend again<br/>
          and I am sworn as His own.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

So he gives spur to Gringolet and picks up the path,<br/>
pushing on through, by a bank, at the side of a wood,<br/>
rode down the rough slope right to the dale.<br/>
And then he gazed all about, and wild it seemed,<br/>
and saw no sign of shelter anywhere near,<br/>
but high banks and steep upon either side,<br/>
and rough rugged crags with gnarled stones;<br/>
so the sky seemed to be grazed by their barbs.<br/>
Then he halted and reined in his horse awhile,<br/>
and scanned all about this chapel to find.<br/>
He saw no such thing either side, and thought it quite strange,<br/>
save a little mound, as it were, off in a field,<br/>
a bald barrow by a bank beside the burn,<br/>
by a force of the flood that flowed down there;<br/>
the burn bubbled therein as if it were boiling.<br/>
The knight urges on his mount and comes to the mound,<br/>
alights there lightly, and ties to a lime-tree<br/>
the reins of his horse round a rough branch.<br/>
Then he goes to the barrow, and about it he walked,<br/>
debating with himself what it might be.<br/>
It had a hole at each end and on either side,<br/>
and was overgrown with grass in great knots;<br/>
and all was hollow within, naught but an old cave,<br/>
or a crevice of an old crag – he could not distinguish<br/>
                    it well.<br/>
          ‘Who knows, Lord,’ quoth the gentle knight<br/>
          ‘whether this be the Green Chapel?<br/>
          Here might about midnight<br/>
          the Devil his Matins tell!’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Now indeed,’ quoth Gawain, ‘desolation is here;<br/>
this oratory is ugly, with weeds overgrown;<br/>
well is it seemly for the man clad in green<br/>
to deal his devotion here in the devil’s wise.<br/>
Now I feel it’s the Fiend, in my five senses,<br/>
who set me this meeting to strike at me here.<br/>
This is a chapel of mischance – bad luck it betide!<br/>
It is the most cursed church that ever I came to.’<br/>
With high helm on his head, his lance in his hand,<br/>
he roamed up to the roof of that rough dwelling.<br/>
Then he heard from that high hill, from a hard rock<br/>
beyond the brook, on the bank, a wondrous brave noise.<br/>
What! It clanged through the cliff as if it would cleave it,<br/>
as if on a grindstone one ground a great scythe.<br/>
What! It whirred and whetted, as water in a mill.<br/>
What! It rushed and rang, revolting to hear.<br/>
Then ‘By God,’ quoth Gawain, ‘this here I believe<br/>
is arranged to reverence me, to greet rank<br/>
                    by rote.<br/>
          ‘Let God’s will work! “Alas” –<br/>
          will help me not a mote.<br/>
          My life though it be lost<br/>
          I dread no wondrous note.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then the knight called out loud on high;<br/>
‘Who stands in this stead, my tryst to uphold?<br/>
For now is good Gawain grounded right here.<br/>
If any man wills aught, wind hither fast,<br/>
either now or never his needs to further.’<br/>
‘Abide,’ quoth one on the bank above his head,<br/>
‘and you shall have all in haste I promised you once.’<br/>
Yet he then turned to his tumult swiftly a while,<br/>
and at whetting he worked, ere he would alight.<br/>
And then he thrust by a crag and came out by a hole,<br/>
whirling out of the rocks with a fell weapon,<br/>
a Danish axe new honed, for dealing the blow,<br/>
with a biting blade bow-bent to the haft,<br/>
ground on a grindstone, four feet broad –<br/>
no less, by that love-lace gleaming full bright.<br/>
And the giant in green was garbed as at first,<br/>
both the looks and the legs, the locks and the beard,<br/>
save that firm on his feet he finds his ground,<br/>
sets the haft to the stones and stalks beside it.<br/>
When he came to the water, he would not wade,<br/>
he hopped over on his axe and boldly he strides,<br/>
blazing with wrath, on a bit of field broad about<br/>
                    in snow.<br/>
          Sir Gawain the man did greet,<br/>
          he bowed to him, nothing low;<br/>
          the other said: ‘Now, Sir Sweet,<br/>
          men may trust your word, I owe.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Gawain,’ quoth the green man, ‘God may you guard!<br/>
Indeed you are welcome, knight, to my place,<br/>
and you have timed your travel as true man should.<br/>
And you know the covenant pledged between us:<br/>
at this time twelvemonth gone you took what befell,<br/>
that I should at this New Year promptly requite.<br/>
And we are in this valley verily alone;<br/>
here are no ranks to sever us, serve as you will.<br/>
Heft your helm off your head, and have here your pay.<br/>
Ask no more debate than I did of you then<br/>
when you whipped off my head at a single blow.’<br/>
‘Nay, by God,’ quoth Gawain, ‘who lent me a soul,<br/>
I shall bear you no grudge for the grief that befalls.<br/>
Strike but the one stroke, and I shall stand still<br/>
and offer no hindrance, come work as you like,<br/>
                    I swear.’<br/>
          He leant down his neck, and bowed,<br/>
          and showed the white flesh all bare,<br/>
          as if he were no way cowed;<br/>
          for to shrink he would not dare.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then the man in green readies him swiftly,<br/>
girds up his grim blade, to smite Gawain;<br/>
with all the strength in his body he bears it aloft,<br/>
manages it mightily as if he would mar him.<br/>
Had he driven it down as direly as he aimed,<br/>
one had been dead of the deed who was dauntless ever.<br/>
But Gawain glanced at the grim blade sideways,<br/>
as it came gliding down on him to destroy him,<br/>
and his shoulders shrank a little from the sharp edge.<br/>
The other man with a shrug the slice withholds,<br/>
and then reproves the prince with many proud words:<br/>
‘You are not Gawain,’ quoth the man, ‘held so great,<br/>
that was never afraid of the host by hill or by vale,<br/>
for now you flinch for fear ere you feel harm.<br/>
Such cowardice of that knight have I never heard.<br/>
I neither flinched nor fled, friend, when you let fly,<br/>
nor cast forth any quibble in King Arthur’s house.<br/>
My head flew off, at my feet, yet fled I never;<br/>
yet you, ere any harm haps, are fearful at heart.<br/>
And I ought to be branded the better man, I say,<br/>
                    therefore.’<br/>
          Quoth Gawain: ‘I flinched once,<br/>
          Yet so will I no more;<br/>
          Though if my head fall on the stones,<br/>
          I cannot it restore.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Be brisk, man, by your faith, and bring me to the point.<br/>
Deal me my destiny and do it out of hand,<br/>
for I shall stand your stroke, and start no more<br/>
till your axe has hit me – have here my troth.’<br/>
‘Have at you, then,’ quoth the other, and heaves it aloft<br/>
and glares as angrily as if he were mad.<br/>
He menaces him mightily, but touches him not,<br/>
swiftly withholding his hand ere it might hurt.<br/>
Gawain gravely it bides and moves not a muscle,<br/>
but stands still as a stone or the stump of a tree<br/>
that is riven in rocky ground with roots a hundred.<br/>
Then merrily again he spoke, the man in green:<br/>
‘So now you have your heart whole, it me behoves.<br/>
Hold you safe now the knighthood Arthur gave you,<br/>
and keep your neck from this cut, if ever it may!’<br/>
Gawain full fiercely with anger then said:<br/>
‘Why, thrash on, you wild man, threaten no longer;<br/>
it seems your heart is warring with your own self.’<br/>
‘Forsooth,’ quoth the other, ‘so fiercely you speak,<br/>
I’ll not a moment longer delay your errand<br/>
                    I vow.’<br/>
          Then he takes up his stance to strike<br/>
          pouts lips and puckers his brow;<br/>
          Nothing there for him to like<br/>
          who hopes for no rescue now.<br/></p>
<p>                             

Up the weapon lifts lightly, is let down fair,<br/>
and the blade’s border beside the bare neck.<br/>
Though heaved heavily it hurt him not more,<br/>
but nicked him on the one side, and severed the skin.<br/>
The sharp edge sank in the flesh through the fair fat,<br/>
so that bright blood over his shoulders shot to the earth.<br/>
And when the knight saw his blood blotting the snow,<br/>
he spurted up, feet first, more than a spear-length,<br/>
seized swiftly his helm and on his head cast it,<br/>
shrugged with his shoulders his fine shield under,<br/>
broke out his bright sword, and bravely he spoke –<br/>
never since he was a babe born of his mother<br/>
had he ever in this world a heart half so blithe –<br/>
‘Back man, with your blade, and brandish no more!<br/>
I have received a stroke in this place without strife,<br/>
and if you offer another I’ll readily requite you<br/>
and yield it you swiftly again – of that be you sure –<br/>
                    as foe.<br/>
          But one stroke to me here falls;<br/>
          the covenant stated so,<br/>
          arranged in Arthur’s halls,<br/>
          so lay your weapon, now, low!’<br/></p>
<p>                             

The other then turned away and on his axe rested,<br/>
set the haft to the earth and leant on the head,<br/>
and looked at the lord who held to his ground,<br/>
how doughty, and dread-less, enduring he stands<br/>
armed, without awe; in his heart he him liked.<br/>
Then he spoke merrily in a mighty voice,<br/>
and with a ringing roar to the knight he said:<br/>
‘Bold man be not so fierce in this field.<br/>
No man here has mistreated you, been unmannerly,<br/>
nor behaved but by covenant at King’s court made.<br/>
I hit with a stroke, and you have it, and are well paid;<br/>
I release you from the rest of all other rights.<br/>
If I had been livelier, a buffet perchance<br/>
I could have worked more wilfully, to bring you anger.<br/>
First I menaced you merrily with a single feint,<br/>
and rent you with no riving cut, rightly offered<br/>
for the pledge that we made on the very first night;<br/>
for you truthfully kept troth and dealt with me true,<br/>
all the gain you gave me, as good men should.<br/>
The next blow for the morn, man, I proffered;<br/>
you kissed my fair wife, the kisses were mine.<br/>
For both these days I brought you but two bare feints,<br/>
                    without scathe.<br/>
          Truth for the truth restore,<br/>
          then man need dread no wraith.<br/>
          On the third you failed for sure,<br/>
          and so took that blow, in faith.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘For it is mine that you wear, that same woven girdle;<br/>
my own wife gave it you, I know it well forsooth.<br/>
Now, know I well your kisses and conduct too,<br/>
and the wooing of my wife; I wrought it myself.<br/>
I sent her to test you, and truly I think you<br/>
the most faultless man that was ever afoot.<br/>
As a pearl beside whitened pea is more precious,<br/>
so is Gawain, in good faith, beside other good knights.<br/>
But here sir you lacked a little, wanting in loyalty;<br/>
but that was for no wily work, nor wooing neither,<br/>
but for love of your life – so I blame you the less.’<br/>
The other strong man in study stood a great while,<br/>
so aggrieved that for grief he grimaced within.<br/>
All the blood of his breast burnt in his face,<br/>
that he shrank for shame at all the man said.<br/>
The first words the knight could frame on that field:<br/>
‘Curse upon cowardice and covetousness both!<br/>
In you are villainy and vice that virtue distress.’<br/>
Then he caught at the knot and pulled it loose,<br/>
and fair flung the belt at the man himself:<br/>
‘Lo! There’s the falseness, foul may it fall!<br/>
For fear of your knock cowardice me taught<br/>
to accord with covetousness, forsake my kind,<br/>
the largesse and loyalty that belongs to knights.<br/>
Now am I faulted and false, and ever a-feared;<br/>
from both treachery and untruth come sorrow<br/>
                    and care!<br/>
          I confess to you knight, here, still,<br/>
          my fault in this affair;<br/>
          let me understand your will,<br/>
          and henceforth I shall beware.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

Then laughed that other lord and lightly said:<br/>
‘I hold it happily made whole, the harm that I had;<br/>
You are confessed so clean, cleared of your faults,<br/>
and have done penance plain at the point of my blade,<br/>
I hold you absolved of that sin, as pure and as clean,<br/>
as though you were never at fault since first you were born.<br/>
And I give you, sir, the girdle that is gold-hemmed.<br/>
As it is green as my gown, Sir Gawain, you may<br/>
think upon this same trial when you throng forth<br/>
among princes of price, and this the pure token<br/>
of the test at the Green Chapel to chivalrous knights.<br/>
And you shall this New Year come back to my castle,<br/>
and we shall revel away the remnant of this rich feast<br/>
                    I mean’<br/>
          Thus urged him hard the lord,<br/>
          and said: ‘With my wife, I ween,<br/>
          we shall bring you in accord,<br/>
          who was your enemy keen.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘Nay, forsooth,’ quoth the knight, and seized his helm<br/>
doffed it deliberately, and dealt his thanks:<br/>
‘I have sojourned enough. May luck you betide,<br/>
and may He yield you reward that rewards all men!<br/>
And commend me to the courteous, your comely wife,<br/>
both the one and the other, my honoured ladies,<br/>
that thus their knight with a trick have cunningly beguiled.<br/>
But it is no wonder for a fool to run mad<br/>
and through wiles of woman be won to sorrow.<br/>
For so was Adam on earth with one beguiled,<br/>
and Solomon with many such, Samson too –<br/>
Delilah dealt him his doom – and David thereafter<br/>
was blinded by Bathsheba, and suffered much ill.<br/>
Since these were wounded with wiles, it were wise<br/>
to love them well and believe them not, if a lord could.<br/>
For these were the finest formerly, favoured by fate<br/>
excellently of all those under heaven’s rule<br/>
                    ill used;<br/>
          And all these were beguiled<br/>
          with women that they used.<br/>
          If I am now beguiled<br/>
          I think I should be excused.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘For your girdle,’ quoth Gawain, ‘God reward you!<br/>
That I will wear with good will, not for the white gold,<br/>
nor the stuff, the silk, nor the slender pendants,<br/>
its worth, nor richness, nor for the fine working;<br/>
but as a sign of my sin I shall see it often<br/>
when I ride in renown, remorseful, remembering<br/>
the fault and the frailty of perverse flesh,<br/>
how it tends to entice to the tarnish of sin.<br/>
And thus when pride shall stir me in prowess of arms,<br/>
one look at this love-lace shall lower my heart.<br/>
But one thing I would you pray, displease you never:<br/>
Since you are lord of yonder land where I lingered<br/>
Say you by your knighthood – may He reward you<br/>
that upholds the heavens and on high sits –<br/>
how you tell your true name, and then no more?’<br/>
‘That shall I tell you truly,’ quoth the other then,<br/>
‘Bertilak de Hautdesert I am in this land,<br/>
through might of Morgan la Faye, that dwells in my house,<br/>
and is mistress of magic, by crafts well learned<br/>
the mysteries of Merlin, many has she taken,<br/>
for she has dealt in depths full dearly sometime<br/>
with that excellent sage, and that know all your knights<br/>
                    at home.<br/>
          Morgan the Goddess<br/>
          therefore is now her name;<br/>
          none has such high haughtiness<br/>
          that she cannot make full tame.’<br/></p>
<p>                             

‘She sent me in this same wise to your wide hall<br/>
for to assay its pride, test if all that were truth<br/>
that runs on the great renown of the Round Table.<br/>
She worked all this wonder your wits to ravel,<br/>
to grieve Guinevere and to bring her to die<br/>
aghast at that same ghoul with his ghostly speech<br/>
with his head in his hand before the high table.<br/>
That is she that is at home, the ancient lady;<br/>
she is even your aunt, Arthur’s half-sister,<br/>
daughter of Tintagel’s Duchess that dear Uther after<br/>
had Arthur upon, who now is your king.<br/>
Therefore, sir, I entreat you, come to your aunt,<br/>
make merry in my house. My men do love you,<br/>
and I wish you as well, man, by my faith,<br/>
as any man under God, for your great truth.’<br/>
Yet Gawain denied him, nay, he would in no way.<br/>
They clasped and kissed, commending each other<br/>
to the Prince of Paradise, parted in the cold where<br/>
                    they stood.<br/>
          Gawain on steed I ween<br/>
          to the King goes fast as he could,<br/>
          and the man in the emerald green<br/>
          whithersoever he would.<br/></p>
<p>                              
 
Wild ways in the world Gawain now rides,<br/>
on Gringolet, he whom grace had gifted with life.<br/>
Often he harboured in houses, and often outside,<br/>
had adventures much in the vales, often vanquisher,<br/>
that I do not at this time intend to recall.<br/>
The hurt was all whole that he had in his neck,<br/>
and the bright belt he bore all thereabout,<br/>
obliquely, as a baldric, bound at his side,<br/>
tied under his left arm, the lace, with a knot,<br/>
as token he was tainted with guilt of his fault.<br/>
And so he comes to the court, all safe and sound.<br/>
Delight dawned in that dwelling when the great knew<br/>
that good Gawain was come; and thought it gain.<br/>
The King kisses the knight, and the queen also,<br/>
and then many staunch knights sought to salute him,<br/>
to know ow he had fared; and faithfully he tells<br/>
confessing all the cost of the cares he had suffered –<br/>
what chanced at the chapel, the cast of its lord,<br/>
the love of the lady, the lace at the last.<br/>
The nick in the neck he naked them showed,<br/>
that he had for his lie, from the lord’s hands,<br/>
                    in blame.<br/>
          He was pained he must tell,<br/>
          he groaned for grief at the same;<br/>
          blood ran to his face pell-mell,<br/>
          when he showed the mark, for shame.<br/></p>
<p>                              
 
‘Lo, Lord!’ quoth the knight, and handled the lace,<br/>
‘This is the belt of blame I bear at my neck,<br/>
this is the hurt and the harm that I have learned<br/>
through the cowardice and covetousness I caught there.<br/>
This is the token of the untruth I am taken in,<br/>
and I must needs it wear while I may last.<br/>
For none may hide harm done, and go unscathed,<br/>
for where it is once attached depart will it never.’<br/>
The King comforts the knight, and all the court also,<br/>
laughing loudly thereat, and lovingly agreeing,<br/>
those lords and ladies that belonged to the Table,<br/>
that each born to the brotherhood, a baldric should have,<br/>
a belt, oblique him about, of a bright green,<br/>
and that for the sake of the knight, the same hue.<br/>
For it was accorded to the renown of the Round Table,<br/>
and he that had it was honoured, evermore after,<br/>
as is borne out by the best book of romance.<br/>
Thus in Arthur’s day this adventure was tried,<br/>
the books of Brutus thereof bear witness.<br/>
Since Brutus, the bold baron, first bent hither,<br/>
after the siege and assault had ceased at Troy,<br/>
                    there is,<br/>
          many an adventure born<br/>
          befallen such, ere this.<br/>
          Now who bears the crown of thorn,<br/>
          May He bring us to his bliss! AMEN.<br/></p>
