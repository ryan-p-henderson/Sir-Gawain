Here are some basic XPath expressions used to gauge the content of the marked-up Gawain document:

//speaker[@narrator='poet']//ref

This found all of the references made by the poet himself. These results could be significant for the determinaation of authorial intent. 
However, there were only 10 places where the poet was explicitly speaking, and the only references that occured more than once were "location" and "chilvaric."

count(//ref[@religion='Christianity']) ; count(//ref[@type='chivalry']) ; count(//ref[@type='nature']) ; etc.

These types of XPath expressions were used to simply find how many of each reference were made.
