Here are some basic XPath expressions used to gauge the content of the marked-up Gawain document:

//speaker[@narrator='poet']//ref

This found all of the references made by the poet himself. These results could be significant for the determinaation of authorial intent. 
However, there were only 10 places where the poet was explicitly speaking and made a reference, and the only references that occured more than once were "location" and "chilvaric."

count(//ref[@religion='Christianity']) ; count(//ref[@type='chivalry']) ; count(//ref[@type='nature']) ; etc.

These types of XPath expressions were used to simply find how many of each reference were made. 

count(//div[position() eq 1]//ref[@type='chivalry']); count(//div[position() eq 1]//ref[@religion='Christianity']); count(//div[position() eq 1]//ref[@type='mythological']); etc.

These types of XPath expressions were used to find the number of particular references for canto, as the themes of each canto could prove significant with respect to the number 
of certain references that appear.
